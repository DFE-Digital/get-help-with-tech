## What devices should be used for

Devices are being provided to help children and young people access social care and receive remote education, as well as support for their safety and wellbeing. In particular they are being provided to:  

*   enable social workers to provide virtual safeguarding and support to children and families with a social worker (e.g. via video-conference);
*   help families and care leavers avoid social isolation and access the services they need online to protect their wellbeing;
*   enable children and young people to access remote learning, including year 10 pupils who have GCSE exams next year.

Local authorities (LAs) and academy trusts own the devices, so they should consider including an acceptable use policy in loan agreements. See our [guidance on loaning devices](/devices/distributing-devices) for more information.

Parents and guardians should provide age-appropriate supervision for the internet use of the children and young people in their care (but LAs should be alert to cases where parents of children with a social worker may not be in a position to do this). They may find the following information helpful:

*   [What parents and carers need to know during school closures](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/closure-of-educational-settings-information-for-parents-and-carers) which includes detailed advice on keeping children safe online. It includes information on home filters, age appropriate parental controls, and how to have age appropriate conversations with children about online safety.
*   [Support for parents and carers to keep children safe from online harm](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/coronavirus-covid-19-keeping-children-safe-online/coronavirus-covid-19-support-for-parents-and-carers-to-keep-children-safe-online), which outlines resources to help keep children safe from different risks online and where to go to receive support and advice
*   [Support to stay safe online](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/covid-19-staying-safe-online), which includes information on security and privacy settings

## Content filtering

LAs and academy trusts are responsible for avoiding risks to the online safety of the children and young people they provide devices to.

The Microsoft Windows devices will come with Cisco Umbrella installed and you can install Cisco Umbrella on Google Chromebooks.

The content filtering has been set up to meet the needs of children and young people of all ages. You can choose to use your own content filtering solution to replace Cisco Umbrella to make it more relevant for your users’ needs.

Please see our guidance on content filtering software for [Google Chromebooks](/devices/preparing-chromebooks) and [Microsoft laptops and tablets](/devices/preparing-microsoft-windows-laptops-and-tablets) for more information.

Updating your Microsoft mobile device management
------------------------------------------------

You’ll receive Microsoft Windows laptops and tablets with security settings already configured and managed by the Department for Education (DfE) using Microsoft Intune.

You can loan the devices out to users straight away as the mobile device management (MDM) will be in place. After 31 March 2021, the MDM will expire and the devices will be unprotected.  

**If you remove the MDM provided by DfE or continue using the devices after 31 March 2021, it’s your responsibility to set up alternative safeguarding measures to avoid risks to the children and young people in your care.**  

You can take control of the devices at any time by restoring them to factory settings and applying your own remote management solution. This will restore the machine to its original state without any DfE software or settings, and it will no longer be enrolled in the DfE device management system.

Please see our guidance on management of [Microsoft laptops and tablets](/devices/preparing-microsoft-windows-laptops-and-tablets) for more information.

## Antivirus and security software

Google Chromebooks will arrive with Chrome OS, which includes virus protection.  

Microsoft laptops and tablets will arrive with Windows 10 and the following antivirus and security software installed:

*   Windows Information Protection
*   Windows Defender Credential/System Guard
*   Windows Defender Exploit Guard
*   Windows Defender Antivirus

## DfE privacy notice: mobile device management for the Department for Education’s ‘Get Help with Technology’ programme

### How we use your personal information

The Get Help with Technology programme is run by the Department for Education (DfE). This privacy notice explains how it will use your personal information.

As part of the Get Help with Technology programme we need to be able to:

*   keep children safe whilst they are online
*   locate, disable and delete data from the laptop that is on loan, if it is lost

We’ve installed mobile device management software on the laptop to do this. The mobile device management solution will collect some personal information when it is implemented on your laptop or tablet.

The DfE is the data controller for the personal information collected when using mobile device management on a laptop or tablet provided through the Get Help with Technology programme.

The personal information collected will be:

*   a device number for the laptop loaned to you
*   your Internet Protool (IP) address, which is a number linked to a device connected to a computer network
*   addresses of websites visited when using the device

For these purposes, the personal information above is securely shared between the DfE and the mobile device management software providers (including their contracted partners), under agreements with the DfE.

Your name is not shared with the DfE or mobile device management software providers (including their contracted partners).

### When we can use your personal information

To use your personal information we need to meet one (or more) conditions in the data protection legislation. For this service we can use your information as part of our legitimate interest.

### How long we hold personal information

Personal information is held by the DfE and the protective software providers (including their contracted partners) for up to 2 years.

### Who we share your personal information with

We only share your personal information with the protective software providers (and their contracted partners) under our agreement for the reasons described above, unless there is a legal requirement for us to share it.

### Your individual rights

Under the Data Protection Act 2018, you’re entitled to ask if we hold information relating to you and ask for a copy, by making a ‘subject access request’.  

For further information and how to request your data, use the ‘contact form’ under the ‘How to find out what personal information we hold about you’ section in the [Personal Information Charter](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/department-for-education/about/personal-information-charter).
