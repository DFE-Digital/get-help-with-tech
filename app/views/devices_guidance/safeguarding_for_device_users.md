Local authorities, academy trusts, schools, colleges and further education institutions all have a responsibility to keep children and young people safe online.

This applies where laptops and tablets are provided through the Department for Education (DfE) Get help with technology programme, as well as any new or refurbished devices received through donations.

## Safeguarding and security settings on devices provided by DfE

Owners of laptops and tablets are responsible for ensuring appropriate content filters and monitoring systems are in place to protect children when they are online.
Devices with pre-installed safeguarding software are available to select at the time of ordering. These come with:

* Cisco Umbrella - content filtering software that blocks a range of illegal and inappropriate content and limits searching to the ‘Safe Search’ provided by popular search engines
* Microsoft Intune - device management software that prevents users from installing unauthorised software or making changes to files and settings

All Chromebooks and iPads will arrive with virus protection in place. Windows devices ordered with DfE settings will have Windows Defender Antivirus software enabled. This setting will need to be applied on standard Windows devices before they’re distributed to users.

Information is available for each device type explaining what safeguarding software is in place, when licenses for these may expire, and how to apply your own settings:

* [Microsoft Windows laptops and tablets without DfE settings](/devices/preparing-a-standard-windows-device)
* [Google Chromebooks](/devices/preparing-chromebooks)
* [Apple iPads](/devices/preparing-ipads)
* [4G wireless routers](/devices/preparing-4g-wireless-routers#router-security)

## Safeguarding and security settings for pre-owned or donated devices

New and refurbished laptops and tablets that have been purchased or donated can help supplement the allocation of laptops and tablets from DfE.

If you receive devices for your school or college through donations, you’re responsible for ensuring they are prepared so they are appropriate for use.

Information we have produced on content filtering, privacy policies and mobile device management is also relevant to any new and pre-owned devices. We recommend you follow our guidance on [preparing a Windows device](/devices/preparing-a-standard-windows-device), [Chromebook](/devices/preparing-chromebooks) or [iPad](/devices/preparing-ipads) before lending a device to a child or young person. 

The following information will help you make decisions on how to set up and manage these devices.

* [Erasing data from donated devices](https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/blog-post/erasing-data-from-donated-devices) - guidance from the National Centre for Cyber Security (NCSC) covering protecting personal data, how to erase data before donating, avoiding unsupported devices, and good cyber practice.

In conversations with parents, carers, and children you should emphasise the importance of a safe online environment and offer support and advice on how to do this. It is also important that children, parents, carers, and school staff are clear on what the reporting mechanisms are if they have any concerns regarding online safety.
