## Laptop and tablet faults

All devices supplied by the Get help with technology programme come with a minimum
12-month manufacturer&rsquo;s warranty.

If you&rsquo;ve ordered Pre-issued devices the warranty period may have already expired.

If you encounter a fault, refer to the manual supplied with the device or the manufacturer&rsquo;s
website for information on how to make a claim.

Depending on the manufacturer&rsquo;s warranty process, you may need to pay courier costs
when returning faulty devices. You&rsquo;ll also need to ensure devices are returned in
appropriate packaging to avoid damage during transit.

Devices returned or replaced by the manufacturer will come with standard factory settings.
It&rsquo;s your responsibility to ensure these devices are safely set up for users. See our
guidance on [preparing a Windows device](/devices/preparing-a-standard-windows-device) for how to apply appropriate safeguarding and
security settings.

We cannot provide support for laptops and tablets after the manufacturer&rsquo;s warranty period
expires. This includes &lsquo;pre-issued&rsquo; devices. Your organisation will need to arrange any
repairs or replacements.

### Returning a Chromebook

When you ordered Chromebooks we asked you to provide your organisation&rsquo;s Google
domain. If you provided this information, we linked your Chromebooks to your Google
admin console.

Before returning a Chromebook, you must deprovision it from your Google domain by
following this guidance: [Repair, repurpose, or retire Chrome devices](https://support.google.com/chrome/a/answer/3523633).

### Returning an iPad

When you ordered iPads we asked you to provide us with your Apple School Manager
(ASM) ID. If you provided this information, we linked your iPads to your organisation&rsquo;s
ASM.

Before returning an iPad, you must unassign your iPad from your ASM by following this
guidance: [Assign, reassign or unassign devices in Apple School Manager](https://support.apple.com/en-gb/guide/apple-school-manager/asmf500c0851/web).
