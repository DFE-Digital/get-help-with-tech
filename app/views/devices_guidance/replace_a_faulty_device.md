## Replace a faulty Google Chromebook or Microsoft device

### If it is not working within 3 days of receiving it

If a device will not start, check it’s fully charged and plugged into the mains. If you still cannot start the device, email [COVID.TECHNOLOGY@education.gov.uk](mailto:COVID.TECHNOLOGY@education.gov.uk) with ‘Device won’t start’ in the subject line. Include your order number and the device serial number so that we can help you as quickly as possible.

### If a device stops working after 3 days

School, local authority and academy trust contacts can raise a support request on the [Support Portal](https://computacenterprod.service-now.com/dfe) from 4 January 2021 to request a replacement for a faulty device. 

Requests for replacement devices from schools will be sent to the local authority or academy trust to be approved. The reason we ask for approval is because if the device has stopped working because a user has damaged the device, your local authority or academy trust will be charged for a replacement.

Before placing a request for a warranty replacement, you should check the device and attempt to resolve the issue. Software problems and physically damaged devices are not covered by the warranty replacement service. Information on ‘How to triage a hardware fault’ is available on the [Support Portal](https://computacenterprod.service-now.com/dfe).

### How to access the Support Portal

Go to the [Support Portal](https://computacenterprod.service-now.com/dfe) and select ‘Raise a support request’ and select ‘Faulty device (school)’. You will need to enter the serial number for the faulty laptop or tablet.

If you have any issues accessing or using the support portal, [contact us](/get-support) with your order tracking number.

## Cost of replacement Windows device or Google Chromebook

Your faulty laptop or tablet will be replaced free of charge if the device is returned, on time, in a complete state and the fault was not caused by a user. 

Local authorities or academy trusts approving schools’ requests will be charged in certain situations, as follows. These costs include courier charges but exclude VAT.
