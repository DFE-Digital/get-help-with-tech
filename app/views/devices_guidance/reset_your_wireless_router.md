## If you have a Huawei router  

To continue using your Huawei router, you must reset your router before 16 July 2021 and insert a different SIM card.

If you do not do this, you’ll be unable to use another SIM card when the data runs out.

Using another SIM card will remove the content filters. Read our [safeguarding guidance](/devices/safeguarding-for-device-users) and information for parents and carers on [keeping children safe online](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/coronavirus-covid-19-keeping-children-safe-online/coronavirus-covid-19-support-for-parents-and-carers-to-keep-children-safe-online).

### Before you start

It will take between 5 and 10 minutes to reset your router. You should read all the steps before you begin.

You’ll need your Huawei router and the router’s wifi network name and password - you can find these on a label under the back cover of your router.

You’ll also need a laptop, tablet or mobile phone.

### Reset your Huawei router

Once you have your wifi network name and password, follow the steps below.

1. Connect your laptop, tablet or mobile phone to the router through the wireless network or the USB cable. (If you have problems connecting, you can read our [Huawei router setup guide](/devices/4g-user-guidance#setting-up-a-huawei-router)).

1. Open a web browser and type [http://192.168.8.1](http://192.168.8.1) in the address bar to get to the Huawei login screen. If the page is blocked you may need to add 192.168.8.1 and 192.168.9.1 to your allow list.

1. Get your Huawei login password.

    <a href="/sign-in" class="govuk-link app-emphasis-link">
      Sign in to see your Huawei router password
    </a>

    Enter your password on the Huawei login screen and click ‘Log in’.

1. Once connected, you’ll be asked to read and accept the privacy notice and user agreement.

1. Choose whether you want overnight updates - we recommend you select ‘Enable and continue’.

1. You’ll be asked if you want to change your wifi name and password - we recommend you keep the ones you have.

1. Choose a new device login password - this should be at least 8 characters and different from your wifi password. You must make a note of this password as you may need it later. Select ‘Finish’. You should now be on the router settings homepage.

1. You should get an alert about a software update. Check your router is plugged into an electrical outlet and select ‘Update’.

Warning text ‘During this update, the device may disconnect from the internet. The device must remain connected to a power source in order to prevent any damage. Bengin update?’. A button labelled ‘Update’.](/devices/huawei-update-version.png)

Once the update has downloaded it will begin to install automatically - this should take approximately 5 minutes. Router lights may turn on and off during this time.

You’ll get a notification once the installation is finished.

### Check your router has been reset

After you have downloaded and installed the software update, you should be redirected to the Huawei login screen. If you need to access this screen manually, open a web browser and enter [http://192.168.8.1](http://192.168.8.1) in the address bar.

<div class="govuk-inset-text">
  You may find that the language has defaulted to non-English. You can change the language back by clicking the dropdown menu named ‘Taal’ in the top-right of the screen and selecting ‘English’.
</div>

Enter the new device login password that you chose and click ‘Log in’. If you are redirected to the router settings homepage, your Huawei router is now reset and ready to use.

The SIM card supplied with the router will provide data until 31 July 2021. You can replace this with an alternative SIM card at any time.

If you are unable to access the router settings:

- check if you’ve entered the device login password correctly - this is the one you chose when you reset your router and is different to your wifi password

- make sure you have installed and downloaded the software update to reset your router

- [contact us](/get-support) if you’re still having difficulties

##If you have a TP-Link or D-Link router 


If you have a TP-Link or D-Link router, you can reset your router and insert another SIM card at any time. If you choose to do this before 31 July 2021, your router will no longer receive data from DfE.

Using another SIM card will remove the content filters. Read our [safeguarding guidance](devices/safeguarding-for-device-users) and information for parents and carers on [keeping children safe online](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/coronavirus-covid-19-keeping-children-safe-online/coronavirus-covid-19-support-for-parents-and-carers-to-keep-children-safe-online).

### Before you start

This process will take around 5 minutes. You should make sure the router is turned on and fully charged.

You will need a pin, paperclip or similar object.

Resetting the router means it will no longer work with the SIM card it came with. 

1. Remove the back cover from the router. 

1. Locate the ‘Reset’ button next to the battery and insert a sharp object (such as a pin or paperclip).

1. Hold down the ‘Reset’ button for 5 seconds to erase the router’s current settings.

1. Remove the battery and take out the current SIM card (the one provided with your router).

1. Insert a replacement SIM card, then replace the battery and back cover.

1. To activate the new SIM card, use the power button to turn the router off and on again.
