Local authorities (LAs) and academy trusts will [own these devices](/devices/distributing-devices) and will need to support their users.

The Department for Education’s delivery partner, XMA, will provide local admin passwords for Windows devices, so that you can reset the devices to add your own settings. 

For support with 4G wireless routers key contacts (the person that completed your device forecast) can access [a support portal](https://computacenterprod.service-now.com/dfe). They can also share access with colleagues.

## Support for schools, young people and families

LAs and academy trusts need to provide support for end users – schools, children, young people and families.  

Those providing support in LAs and academy trusts should be able to solve general IT problems (such as password resets) so that the end user can continue with their day as soon as possible.

## Support for local authorities and academy trusts

XMA will support LAs and academy trusts. Their technical service desk can:

* provide local admin passwords to remove Microsoft Intune
* help you manage Mobile Device Management (MDM) and Cisco Umbrella settings

The key contact (the person that completed your device forecast) or technical contact (nominated when the order was placed) can request this support by raising a ticket with the XMA Service Desk.

Log an issue by emailing [DFE.Support@xma.co.uk](mailto:DFE.Support@xma.co.uk)

To help us verify you for security, please make sure you email us from that address that:

* you used to complete the device forecast (if you’re a key contact)

was entered when the devices were ordered (if you’re a technical contact) Once you have contacted the XMA Service Desk, they will log a ticket and send a confirmation email with a unique reference number.

Tickets will be prioritised depending on how urgent they are, and the impact of the issue. The incident or request will be sent to the relevant support staff to help with your issue.

## Microsoft Windows devices: how to get support

### If you receive a device that does not work on arrival 

If you receive a Microsoft Windows device that does not turn on, log in to the [Computacenter support portal](https://computacenterprod.service-now.com/dfe) using the access details sent to the key contact(s) nominated when devices were ordered. Find out [how to return faulty devices](#Replacing-a-faulty-device).

### If a Windows device develops a fault

If a fault is discovered by you or someone you loan it to before 19 December 2020, we’ll arrange to fix or replace it. Find out [how to return faulty devices](#Replacing-a-faulty-device) and the costs associated with doing so. 

If you discover a fault with the devices after 19 December 2020, it may still be covered by the manufacturer’s warranty. Please contact the manufacturer by following the returns information included with the device.

### Receiving a replacement device from Computacenter

Your replacement will be built identically to the original device, and will automatically be enrolled in mobile device management (MDM) and content filtering software. You can contact the XMA Service Desk by emailing [DFE.Support@xma.co.uk](mailto:DFE.Support@xma.co.uk)) if you have any issues.


### Receiving a replacement device from the manufacturer

As Computacenter will not have been involved in the replacement process, the device will arrive without Microsoft Intune or Cisco Umbrella installed. To ensure devices are appropriately protected to avoid the risk of young people accessing harmful content, please email the XMA Service Desk at [DFE.Support@xma.co.uk](mailto:DFE.Support@xma.co.uk)) to get your device enrolled before distributing it.

## If you want to remove Microsoft Intune to install your own mobile device management (MDM)

Find out [how to reset your device to factory settings to set up your own MDM](#How-to-reset-Microsoft-Windows-devices-so-you-can-add-your-own-software-and-settings).

The XMA Service Desk support is limited to the provision of local admin passwords to remove Microsoft Intune and to manage global MDM and Cisco Umbrella settings for every device enrolled.

Please do not reset the device until you are ready to apply your own MDM. Once the Microsoft Windows device has been reset to factory default settings, it will no longer have Microsoft Intune or Cisco Umbrella installed.

## 4G wireless routers: how to get support

### If you receive a faulty 4G Wireless Router 

If you receive a 4G wireless router that will not start, please check that it is fully charged. If it still won’t power-up, email [DepartmentforEducation@computacenter.com](mailto:DepartmentforEducation@computacenter.com) with the order number and IMEI number on the device.

### If you have technical issues with 4G wireless routers 

If your 4G wireless router has powered-up but you are experiencing technical issues, for example if you need to:

    * deactivate a SIM

    * reconfigure an existing device

Please raise a ticket via the dedicated [Computacenter support portal](https://computacenterprod.service-now.com/dfe).

## Replacing a faulty device

The [Computacenter support portal](https://computacenterprod.service-now.com/dfe) allows local authorities and academy trusts to request replacement devices and monitor the progress of their orders.

If you work within social care or a school, please report faulty devices to your local authority or academy trust so they can manage the process of requesting a replacement.

### If a device is not working when you receive it

We’ll repair or replace it under our warranty support service. We’ll provide you with a replacement device within 2 working days of returning a device. This is significantly faster than requesting a replacement through the manufacturer’s warranty process.

* For Microsoft and Chromebook devices, our warranty support is available for faults reported before 19 December 2020
* For 4G routers, our warranty support is available for faults reported within 5 days of receiving your device

When returning a device, you should be aware that:

* if a device is returned with a fault that’s not covered by the manufacturer’s warranty, you’ll be charged £220 for the repair. A list of faults that are not covered is available in the support portal within the ‘How to request a warranty replacement’ article, along with information on ‘How to triage hardware issues’

   * £208.29 for a replacement Windows laptop device
   * £154.40 for a replacement Windows tablet device
   * £235.62 for a replacement Chromebook
* if you fail to include the original power charger along with your returned device you’ll be charged up to £35 per replacement
* if you fail to meet the courier collecting your faulty device(s) within 30 minutes of the agreed time, you’ll incur a charge of £81 per visit

All costs include courier charges but exclude VAT.

### If a device develops a fault after 19 December 2020

Devices come with a 12-month manufacturer’s warranty that will expire between May and July 2021, depending on when your device was delivered to us. Please note, this will be earlier than the date it was received by you.

If you find a fault with the device after the initial warranty support service period ends, please follow the return instructions issued by the manufacturer of the device, which will be included in the box.

You can contact the manufacturer to ask for an extension to the 12-month manufacturer’s warranty. The management and associated costs of this will be the responsibility of the local authorities and trusts who own the devices.

Please note that SIMs will not work on the day you receive the 4G wireless routers because they will not be activated until the following day. The data allowance will start from this point and will remain active for 6 months. You should wait until the day after you receive the 4G wireless routers before loaning the devices to users.

If your 4G wireless router will not start, please check that it is fully charged.

You can use the [EdTech Demonstrator Programme](https://edtech-demonstrator.lgfl.net/) to contact a network of schools and colleges who are already using remote education technology resources for help and support.
