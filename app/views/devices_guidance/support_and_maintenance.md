Local authorities (LAs), academy trusts and schools will [own these devices](/devices/distributing-devices) and will need to support their users.

If you’re an authorised user, you can use the [Support Portal](https://computacenterprod.service-now.com/dfe) to access local admin and BIOS passwords if you want to reset Microsoft Windows devices to add your own settings.

For support with 4G wireless routers, you can access the [Support Portal](https://computacenterprod.service-now.com/dfe). If you ordered after September 2020 then anyone with a TechSource account can request this support. You can also share access with colleagues.

## Support for schools, young people and families

Where devices are owned by LAs and academy trusts, they will need to provide support for end users – schools, children, young people and families.

Where devices are owned by schools, they will need to provide support to the pupils they loan them to.

Those providing support should be able to solve general IT problems (such as password resets) so that the end user can continue using their device as soon as possible.

## Support for local authorities, academy trusts and schools

If you work for a local authority, academy trust or school and need help with any of the devices provided by this programme, please email [COVID.TECHNOLOGY@education.gov.uk](mailto:DFE.COVID.TECHNOLOGY@education.gov.uk). We aim to respond within 4 working days.

## Replacing a faulty device

[Find out how to get a replacement for a faulty laptop, tablet or 4G wireless router](/devices/replace-a-faulty-device), the cost to replace a damaged device, how to service and repair an iPad and other warranty details.

If your laptop, Microsoft tablet or 4G wireless router develops a fault, we’ll arrange to replace it from 4 January 2021.

## Request local admin and BIOS passwords, and install your own software and settings

Please [see our guidance on preparing Microsoft Windows devices](https://get-help-with-tech.education.gov.uk/devices/preparing-microsoft-windows-laptops-and-tablets) for information.

## Remove Microsoft Intune to install your own mobile device management (MDM)

Find out [how to reset your device to factory settings to set up your own MDM](https://get-help-with-tech.education.gov.uk/devices/preparing-microsoft-windows-laptops-and-tablets).

Please do not reset the device until you are ready to apply your own MDM. Once the Microsoft Windows device has been reset to factory default settings, it will no longer have Microsoft Intune or Cisco Umbrella installed.

## 4G wireless routers: how to get support

Please review our [preparing 4G routers](/devices/preparing-4g-wireless-routers) and [get started with your 4G wireless router](/devices/4g-user-guidance) guidance to see if your issue is covered before raising support queries. 


### If you receive a faulty 4G Wireless Router 

If you receive a 4G wireless router that will not start, please check that it is fully charged. If it still won’t power-up, email [COVID.TECHNOLOGY@education.gov.uk](mailto:covid.technology@education.gov.uk) with the order number and IMEI number on the device.

### If you have technical issues with 4G wireless routers 

If a 4G wireless router has powered-up but is experiencing technical issues, trusts and local authorities can check the status of each router and if needed raise an issue via the [Support Portal](https://computacenterprod.service-now.com/dfe). Login details will have been provided when you placed your order, but if you’re unable to access, please email [COVID.TECHNOLOGY@education.gov.uk](mailto:covid.technology@education.gov.uk).

It is important that users do not attempt to reset their device to try to resolve issues, as this will cause both the router and the SIM to stop workin.
Schools and colleges will need to ask their trust or local authority to access the [Support Portal](https://computacenterprod.service-now.com/dfe) on their behalf. Email [COVID.TECHNOLOGY@education.gov.uk](mailto:covid.technology@education.gov.uk) if you’re unsure who to contact.

We can help you to:
 
* deactivate a SIM
* un-bar a SIM
* request a replacement device
* reconfigure an existing device

We are unable to increase data limits if a user has used 20GB within a month. Please advise them that this will reset on the first of the next month and that data should only be used to access remote education, with ‘Standard Definition’ (SD) video selected where possible.
