Local authorities (LAs), academy trusts and schools will [own these devices](/devices/distributing-devices) and will need to support their users.

If you’re an authorised user, you can use the [Support Portal](https://computacenterprod.service-now.com/dfe) to access local admin and BIOS passwords if you want to reset Microsoft Windows devices to add your own settings.

For support with 4G wireless routers, key contacts (the person that completed your device forecast) and technical contacts can access the [Support Portal](https://computacenterprod.service-now.com/dfe). If you ordered after September 2020 then anyone with a TechSource account can request this support. They can also share access with colleagues.

## Support for schools, young people and families

Where devices are owned by LAs and academy trusts, they will need to provide support for end users – schools, children, young people and families.

Where devices are owned by schools, they will need to provide support to the pupils they loan them to.

Those providing support should be able to solve general IT problems (such as password resets) so that the end user can continue using their device as soon as possible.

## Support for local authorities, academy trusts and schools

If you work for a local authority, academy trust or school and need help with any of the devices provided by this programme, please email [COVID.TECHNOLOGY@education.gov.uk](mailto:DFE.COVID.TECHNOLOGY@education.gov.uk). We aim to respond within 3 working days.

### If you receive a device that does not work on arrival 

If you receive a Microsoft Windows device that does not turn on, log in to the [Support Portal](https://computacenterprod.service-now.com/dfe) using the access details sent to the key contact(s) nominated when devices were ordered. Find out [how to return faulty devices](#replacing-a-faulty-device).

### If a Windows device develops a fault

If you received your device between May and August 2020 and a fault is discovered by you or someone you loan it to before 19 December 2020, we’ll arrange to fix or replace it. Find out [how to return faulty devices](#replacing-a-faulty-device) and the costs associated with doing so. 

If you received your device after September 2020 or discover a fault with the devices after 19 December 2020, it may still be covered by the manufacturer’s warranty. Please contact the manufacturer by following the returns information included with the device.

### Receiving a replacement device

Your replacement will be provided identically to the original device, and will automatically be enrolled in mobile device management (MDM) and content filtering software if you requested that in your original order. Please contact [COVID.TECHNOLOGY@education.gov.uk](mailto:COVID.TECHNOLOGY@education.gov.uk) if you have any issues.

### Receiving a replacement device from the manufacturer

The device will arrive without Microsoft Intune or Cisco Umbrella installed. To ensure devices are appropriately protected to avoid the risk of young people accessing harmful content, please email [COVID.TECHNOLOGY@education.gov.uk](mailto:COVID.TECHNOLOGY@education.gov.uk) to get your device enrolled before distributing it.

## If you want to remove Microsoft Intune to install your own mobile device management (MDM)

Find out [how to reset your device to factory settings to set up your own MDM](/devices/preparing-microsoft-windows-laptops-and-tablets).

Please do not reset the device until you are ready to apply your own MDM. Once the Microsoft Windows device has been reset to factory default settings, it will no longer have Microsoft Intune or Cisco Umbrella installed.

## 4G wireless routers: how to get support

### If you receive a faulty 4G Wireless Router 

If you receive a 4G wireless router that will not start, please check that it is fully charged. If it still won’t power-up, email [COVID.TECHNOLOGY@education.gov.uk](mailto:covid.technology@education.gov.uk) with the order number and IMEI number on the device.

### If you have technical issues with 4G wireless routers 

If your 4G wireless router has powered-up but you are experiencing technical issues, for example if you need to:
 
* deactivate a SIM
* un-bar a SIM
* request a replacement device
* reconfigure an existing device

Please raise a ticket via the dedicated [Support Portal](https://computacenterprod.service-now.com/dfe). If you do not have log in details, please contact the key contact for the device. This will be the person at the local authority or academy trust who completed the device forecast.

## Replacing a faulty device

If you work in social care or a school that does not own the device, please report faults to your local authority or academy trust so they can manage the process of requesting a replacement.

### If a device is not working within 3 days of receiving it

We’ll provide you with a replacement device within 2 working days of returning a device.

If a device will not start, please check it’s fully charged and plugged into the mains. If you still cannot start the device, email [COVID.TECHNOLOGY@education.gov.uk](mailto:covid.technology@education.gov.uk) with ‘Device won’t start’ in the subject line. Please include your order number and the device serial number so that we can help you as quickly as possible.

If you find a fault with the device after the initial warranty support service period ends, please follow the return instructions issued by the manufacturer of the device, which will be included in the box.

### For Windows and Chromebook devices issued between May and August 2020 and all 4G routers

If your device develops a fault after 3 working days of delivery, warranty support is available for faults reported before 19th December 2020.

Local authority and academy trust contacts can raise a support request on the [Support Portal](https://computacenterprod.service-now.com/dfe). Replacement devices will be provided within 2 working days of a ticket being logged.

Before placing a request for a warranty replacement we recommended you carry out an initial diagnosis to establish whether the fault is software or hardware related. Software problems and physically damaged devices are not covered by the warranty replacement service. Information on 'How to triage a hardware fault' is available on the [Support Portal](https://computacenterprod.service-now.com/dfe).

If you have any issues accessing or using the support portal, please email [COVID.TECHNOLOGY@education.gov.uk](mailto:covid.technology@education.gov.uk) with your order tracking number.

When returning a device, you should be aware that:

* if a device is returned with a fault that’s not covered by the manufacturer’s warranty, you’ll be charged £220 for the repair. A list of faults that are not covered is available in the support portal within the ‘How to request a warranty replacement’ article, along with information on ‘How to triage hardware issues’
* if you return a device and no fault is found, or return a device that was not provided as part of this offer, you’ll be charged £108 per device for handling plus:
   * £208.29 for a replacement Windows laptop device
   * £154.40 for a replacement Windows tablet device
   * £235.62 for a replacement Chromebook
* if you fail to include the original power charger along with your returned device you’ll be charged up to £35 per replacement
* if you fail to meet the courier collecting your faulty device(s) within 30 minutes of the agreed time, you’ll incur a charge of £81 per visit

All costs include courier charges but exclude VAT.

### If a device develops a fault after 19 December 2020

Devices come with a 12-month manufacturer’s warranty that will expire within 12 months of when you received the device.

If you find a fault with the device after the initial warranty support service period ends, please follow the return instructions issued by the manufacturer of the device, which will be included in the box.

You can contact the manufacturer to ask for an extension to the 12-month manufacturer’s warranty. The management and associated costs of this will be the responsibility of the local authorities and trusts who own the devices.

Please note that SIMs will not work on the day you receive the 4G wireless routers because they will not be activated until the following day. The data allowance will start from this point and will remain active for 6 months. You should wait until the day after you receive the 4G wireless routers before loaning the devices to users.

If your 4G wireless router will not start, please check that it is fully charged.

You can use the [EdTech Demonstrator Programme](https://edtech-demonstrator.lgfl.net/) to contact a network of schools and colleges who are already using remote education technology resources for help and support.
