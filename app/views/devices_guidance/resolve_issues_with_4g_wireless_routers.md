See our guidance on [preparing 4G routers](/devices/preparing-4g-wireless-routers) and [getting started with your 4G wireless router](/devices/4g-user-guidance) for support with setting up and using routers.

## Resetting your router

All 4G wireless routers come with SIM cards that provide data until 31 July 2021. To continue using routers after this date, you must [reset them and replace their SIM cards](/devices/using-your-router-after-31-july-2021).

## If a router won't start

If you receive a router that will not start, check that it’s fully charged. If it still will not power up, [contact us](/get-support) with the order number and the IMEI number on the device.

## If a router won't connect to the internet

If a user reports that their router powers up but will not connect to the internet, there are a few options to try before you report a fault. Ask the user to check if:

* another device (such as a smartphone) has a connection to see if there are issues in the local area
* the SIM card has been removed - if it has, ask them to put it back into the router and try to connect again
* the laptop or tablet they’re using can connect to the internet another way, for example by using free wifi or tethering it to a mobile phone
* they can clear the cache on the web browser they’re using, then try to connect again

  Do not attempt to reset the router to try to resolve issues, this will cause both the router and the SIM to stop working.

## Checking 4G wireless router status

### Local authorities and trusts

Local authorities and trusts can use the [Support Portal](https://computacenterprod.service-now.com/dfe) to check the status of each router, and raise a support request if needed. Login details were provided when you placed your order, but if you’re unable to access the Support Portal, [contact us](/get-support).

You can use the [Support Portal](https://computacenterprod.service-now.com/dfe) to:

* check if a router’s data cap has been reached (the data cannot be increased)
* reactivate a SIM that’s been removed from the router
* deactivate a SIM if the router is lost or stolen
* request a replacement router
* reconfigure a router
* request connectivity support

### Schools and colleges

You can check the status of each router in the [Support Portal](https://computacenterprod.service-now.com/dfe) using the login details provided when you placed your order. If you need to raise an issue, you will need to ask your trust or local authority to do this on your behalf. [Contact us](/get-support) if you’re unsure who to contact.
