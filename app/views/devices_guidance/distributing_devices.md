## Who owns the devices

Local authorities (LAs) and academy trusts will own the devices (and the licenses) they receive, and will continue to do so after we come out of coronavirus (COVID-19) measures. This means devices can continue to support children and young peopleâ€™s education and online access to social care services.

LAs and academy trusts can choose to:

* loan devices directly to families, children and young people
* transfer ownership to schools
* gift devices to care leavers

[Guidance on safe internet use](https://www.saferinternet.org.uk/) should be provided when devices are loaned or gifted.

LAs and academy trusts should avoid transferring ownership directly to children and families. This helps ensure that safeguarding solutions like web filtering remain in place.

## Distributing devices

Laptops, tablets and 4G wireless routers will be delivered directly to the schools or local authorities named in the application. [Please see the receiving devices guidance for more information](/devices/receiving-devices).

Organisations are responsible for deciding how they deliver devices. For example, they can:

* arrange for them to be collected by families from school with a social worker present (where relevant)
* organise for them to be delivered to the homes of children and care leavers
* arrange for schools to deliver them
* use local organisations, such as those supporting care leavers

Distribution should be arranged in accordance with [social distancing guidelines](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/staying-alert-and-safe-social-distancing).

## Loan agreements

LAs, academy trusts and schools could consider using loan agreements when distributing devices to children and young people. This agreement could set out the terms and conditions of the loan, including who is responsible for what.

[The Key for School Leaders](https://covid19.thekeysupport.com/covid-19/deliver-remote-learning/make-tech-work-you/loaning-it-equipment-pupils-and-staff/#section-1) has templates and examples of how to set these up.

## Insuring your devices

## Labelling or tagging devices

Laptops, tablets and 4G wireless routers will not be tagged or labelled when they are delivered. LAs and trusts are responsible for implementing their own security and tracking methods.

See the [guidance on preparing devices](/devices/preparing-chromebooks) for information on setting up mobile device management (MDM) and keeping records of devices.
