    The person who placed a Chromebook order will receive an email from deal-fulfillment@google.com including important information regarding device setup. We suggest this email is forwarded to the technical contact responsible for preparing Chromebooks.

This guidance is written with reference to Chromebooks provided through the Get help with technology programme. It also applies to any new or refurbished devices a school or college has received through donations. Further information on [erasing data from donated devices](https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/blog-post/erasing-data-from-donated-devices) is available from the National Cyber Security Centre.

## How to enrol Chromebooks

You need to enrol your Chromebooks so you can manage them remotely. Follow the appropriate guidance below for your devices:

* [User login required](/devices/enrol-chromebooks-with-user-logins) – suitable for users linked to schools
* [No user login required](/devices/enrol-chromebooks-without-user-logins) – suitable for users linked to local authorities (for example, those in social care)

## Getting a Google domain

When you ordered your Google Chromebooks you provided your Google domain, which we used to link to your licenses for the Google Admin console.

If you didn’t enter a Google domain and don’t have one, you can set one up. Schools can set up a Google Domain and get access to Google for Education by [applying for government-funded support](/digital-platforms).

For Chromebooks for children linked to schools, local authorities should use the school’s domain so that children can access their remote education as well as social care. If the Chromebook is for a young person who is not linked to a school, local authorities can [set up a Google domain for care leavers and families with children that have a social worker](/devices/google-domain-for-care-leavers-and-children-with-social-worker).

## Chromebook settings and software

### Content filtering

You should ensure that enrolled devices have appropriate security settings in place to keep users safe online. Content filtering software Cisco Umbrella is included with Chromebooks until 30 September 2021 which can be activated when you enrol your devices.

It’s your responsibility to avoid risks to the online safety of the children and young people you are providing devices to. You can arrange for your own Cisco Umbrella licenses to extend beyond 30 September 2021 or enable alternative security settings.

Websites users visit on their devices will be logged by Cisco Umbrella, but DfE will not monitor these logs and they will not be available to schools, local authorities or trusts. DfE may turn logging on when adjusting filtering rules to test whether they are effective.

This filtering should not prevent legitimate use of the devices. [Contact us](/get-support) to report instances where legitimate use is blocked or inappropriate content can be accessed.

### Software

Chromebooks come with Chrome OS. This manages:

* encryption
* anti-malware
* anti-virus

Chromebooks have the H1 Secure Microcontroller, which is Google’s version of TPM (Microsoft’s encrypted processor). This allows patching and OS updates to be installed more quickly, so it’s easier to keep devices up to date.

Children and young people can also use:

* Google Docs
* Google Sheets
* Google Slides

## User guidance for young people and their carers

Our guidance on [how to get started with your Google Chromebook](/devices/getting-started-with-your-google-chromebook) can be shared with young people and their parents, guardians and carers. 

You may want to add contact information to this guidance for the person or team offering IT support to device users.
