The person who placed the Chromebook order received an email from
<span class="app-no-wrap">deal-fulfillment@google.com</span>, including important information about device setup.

At the time we suggested they forward this email to the technical contact responsible for preparing
Chromebooks.

This guidance is for Chromebooks provided through the Get help with technology
programme, as well as new or refurbished devices a school or college receives through
donations. Further information on
[erasing data from donated devices](https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/blog-post/erasing-data-from-donated-devices)
is available from the
National Cyber Security Centre.

## How to enrol Chromebooks

When you ordered your Google Chromebooks we asked you to provide your Google domain,
which we use to link to your licences for the Google Admin console.

You need to enrol your Chromebooks so you can manage them remotely.

Before you enrol your devices, ensure that you have the correct number of Chrome
licences available in your domain by going to <span class="app-no-wrap">&lsquo;Devices&rsquo; > &lsquo;Chrome devices&rsquo;</span> and selecting
the &lsquo;Upgrades&rsquo; button in the top right.

First, create an organisational unit called &lsquo;DfE Devices&rsquo; in your Google Admin Console,
then follow these instructions to enrol your devices:

1. Unbox multiple devices and turn on.
1. Connect to WiFi.
1. On the login screen press &lsquo;ctrl&rsquo; + &lsquo;alt&rsquo; + &lsquo;e&rsquo; (or select &lsquo;More options&rsquo; > &lsquo;Enterprise Enrollment&rsquo;).
1. Enter credentials on enrolment screen (use credentials from an account on your domain).
1. Wait for &lsquo;Your Chromebook has been successfully enrolled&rsquo; and select &lsquo;Next&rsquo;.

### Content filtering

<div class="govuk-inset-text">
  <p>
    Google Chromebooks provided by Get help with technology from October 2021 did not
    come with web filtering software. You should arrange your own security settings to ensure
    the devices are safe for children and young people to use.
  </p>
</div>

Chromebooks provided before October 2021 through the Get help with technology
programme came with the option of Cisco Umbrella content filtering. Licences for Cisco
Umbrella that were provided by DfE are not intended to be a permanent solution. You
should
[remove Cisco Umbrella from Chromebooks](/devices/remove-dfe-provided-cisco-umbrella-from-chromebooks)
and enable alternative security settings
as soon as possible. It&rsquo;s your responsibility to ensure the online safety of the children and
young people you&rsquo;re providing devices to.

## Software

Chromebooks come with Chrome OS. This manages:

* encryption
* anti-malware
* anti-virus

Chromebooks have the H1 Secure Microcontroller, which is Google&rsquo;s version of TPM
(Microsoft&rsquo;s encrypted processor). This allows patching and OS updates to be installed
more quickly, so it&rsquo;s easier to keep devices up to date.

Children and young people can also use:

* Google Docs
* Google Sheets
* Google Slides
