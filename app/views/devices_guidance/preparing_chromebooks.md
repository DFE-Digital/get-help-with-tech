The person who placed a Chromebook order will receive an email from
<span class="app-no-wrap">deal-fulfillment@google.com</span> including important information regarding device setup. We
suggest this email is forwarded to the technical contact responsible for preparing 
Chromebooks.

This guidance is written with reference to Chromebooks provided through the Get help 
with technology programme. It also applies to any new or refurbished devices a school or 
college has received through donations. Further information on [erasing data from donated devices](https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/blog-post/erasing-data-from-donated-devices) 
is available from the National Cyber Security Centre.

## Getting a Google domain

When you ordered your Google Chromebooks you provided your Google domain, which 
we used to link to your licenses for the Google Admin console.

If you didn’t enter a Google domain and don’t have one, you can set one up. Schools can
set up a Google Domain and get access to Google for Education by [applying for government-funded support](/digital-platforms).

For Chromebooks for children linked to schools, local authorities should use the school’s 
domain so that children can access their remote education as well as social care. If the 
Chromebook is for a young person who is not linked to a school, local authorities can 
[set up a Google domain for care leavers and families with children that have a social worker](/devices/google-domain-for-care-leavers-and-children-with-social-worker).

## How to enrol Chromebooks

You need to enrol your Chromebooks so you can manage them remotely.

Before you enrol your devices, please ensure that you have the correct number of Chrome 
licenses available in your domain by going to <span class="app-no-wrap">‘Devices’ > ‘Chrome devices’</span> and clicking the 
‘Upgrades’ button in the top right. If you do not have enough licenses for the number of devices
you need to enrol and manage, please contact [COVID.TECHNOLOGY@education.gov.uk](mailto:COVID.TECHNOLOGY@education.gov.uk).

First, create an organisational unit called ‘DfE Devices’ in your Google Admin Console, then 
follow these instructions to enrol your devices:

1. Unbox multiple devices and turn on
1. Connect to WiFi
1. On the login screen press ‘ctrl’ + ‘alt’ + ‘e’ (or select ‘More options’ > ‘Enterprise Enrollment’)
1. Enter credentials on enrollment screen (use credentials from an account on your domain)
1. Wait for ‘Your Chromebook has been successfully enrolled’ and select ‘Next’

## Chromebook settings and software

### Content filtering

<div class="govuk-inset-text">
  <p>
    Chromebooks provided through the Get Help With Technology programme previously 
    came with the option of Cisco Umbrella content filtering. Licenses for Cisco Umbrella that 
    were provided by DfE are not intended to be a permanent solution. You should enable 
    alternative security settings as soon as possible. It’s your responsibility to avoid risks to the 
    online safety of the children and young people you’re providing devices to. 
  </p>
</div>

Find out [how to remove Cisco Umbrella from Chromebooks](/devices/remove-dfe-provided-cisco-umbrella-from-chromebooks).

#### For devices previously provided that use Cisco Umbrella content filtering

Websites that users visit on their devices will be logged by Cisco Umbrella, but DfE will not 
monitor these logs and they will not be available to schools, local authorities or trusts. DfE 
may turn logging on when adjusting filtering rules to test whether they’re effective.

This filtering should not prevent legitimate use of the devices. [Contact us](/get-support) to report 
instances where legitimate use is blocked or inappropriate content can be accessed.

## Software

Chromebooks come with Chrome OS. This manages:

* encryption
* anti-malware
* anti-virus

Chromebooks have the H1 Secure Microcontroller, which is Google’s version of TPM 
(Microsoft’s encrypted processor). This allows patching and OS updates to be installed 
more quickly, so it’s easier to keep devices up to date.

Children and young people can also use:

* Google Docs
* Google Sheets
* Google Slides

## User guidance for young people and their carers

Our guidance on [how to get started with your Google Chromebook](/devices/getting-started-with-your-google-chromebook) can be shared with 
young people and their parents, guardians and carers.
