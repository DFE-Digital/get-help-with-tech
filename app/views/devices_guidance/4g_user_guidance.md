**Do not remove the SIM, the router will stop working**

**The router will only operate with the SIM card that is already installed. Attempting to use the SIM card with any other device will either not give a data connection or will cause the SIM card to become barred.**

## Charging your router

Connect the micro-USB charging cable included into the micro-USB port on the bottom of the device and connect the other end to any USB charger.

## Getting support with your router

If you have any problems with your router, you should contact \[insert the contact details of your support person below\]:

## Managing your monthly data allowance

Your 4G router has a monthly data cap. When the router runs out of data it will not connect to the internet until more data is added at the beginning of the next month.

To help prevent this, make sure your 4G router’s data connection is only used for education and for social care services.

## Staying safe online

Your 4G wireless router uses a filtering system that blocks some inappropriate content and limits searching to the ‘Safe Search’ supported by popular search engines. The router is also set up to comply with privacy and human rights legislation.

If you’re blocked from viewing something you think you need for your work or wellbeing, get in touch with your school or local authority contact.
