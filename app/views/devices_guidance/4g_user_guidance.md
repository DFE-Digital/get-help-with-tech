## Technical support

For technical support, children and families should contact the trust, local authority or school which sent them the router. They can help with setting up routers or raising an issue if there's a problem with the router or SIM card. 

### For local authorities and trusts

You can check the status of each router and if needed, raise an issue via the [Support Portal](https://computacenterprod.service-now.com/dfe). Login details will have been provided when you placed your order, but if you’re unable to access, [contact us](/get-support).

### For schools and colleges

You can check the status of each router in the [Support Portal](https://computacenterprod.service-now.com/). If you need to raise an issue, you will need to ask your trust or local authority to do this on your behalf. [Contact us](/get-support) if you’re unsure who to contact.

## Staying safe online

4G wireless routers provided by DfE use a filtering system that blocks inappropriate content and limits searching to the ‘Safe Search’ supported by popular search engines. The router is also set up to comply with privacy and human rights legislation.

Users should get in touch with their school or local authority contact if they’re unable to access content required for remote education.

## Safeguarding resources 

These resources include detailed guidance for schools and colleges on safe remote education, virtual lessons, and live streaming. There's also information on how to make sure children and young people are safe online.
