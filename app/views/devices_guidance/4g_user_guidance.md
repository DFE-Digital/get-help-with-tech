For all router types, users will find the following in the box:

- 4G wireless router
- battery (with approximately 25% charge)
- charging cable (micro-USB)
- quick start guides

The router will have a SIM card inserted that provides 20GB of data per month which will reset on the first day of each month.

We suggest you make young people and families aware that:

- SIM cards will remain active until the end of July 2021.
- routers will only work with the SIM provided - attempts to insert an alternative SIM or to use the SIM in another device will result in it being blocked 
- once the 20GB limit has been reached the device will no longer connect to the internet - to reduce data usage, devices should be used for accessing remote education with ‘Standard Definition’ (SD) video selected where possible
- they should not attempt to reset their device to try to resolve issues, as this will result in both the router and SIM to stop working

Step-by-step instructions for each type of router are provided below. These PDFs can be downloaded and provided by schools or local authorities to users to help them get online.

## Technical support

Children and families should raise any queries regarding 4G wireless routers with the trust, local authority or school which sent the device to them. They will be able to support with setting up routers or raising an issue if there is a problem with the router or SIM card.  They should not press the reset button.

### For local authorities and trusts

You can check the status of each router and if needed, raise an issue via the [Support Portal](https://computacenterprod.service-now.com/dfe). Login details will have been provided when you placed your order, but if you’re unable to access, [contact us](/get-support).

### For schools and colleges

You can check the status of each router in the [Support Portal](https://computacenterprod.service-now.com/). If you need to raise an issue, you will need to ask your trust or local authority to do this on your behalf. [Contact us](/get-support) if you’re unsure who to contact.

## Staying safe online

4G wireless routers provided by DfE use a filtering system that blocks inappropriate content and limits searching to the ‘Safe Search’ supported by popular search engines. The router is also set up to comply with privacy and human rights legislation.

Users should get in touch with their school or local authority contact if they’re unable to access content required for remote education.

Parents and guardians of the young people making use of these devices should be aware of advice on supervising internet use by children. Support for parents and carers to keep children safe from online harm is available at [https://www.gov.uk/guidance/safeguarding-and-remote-education-during-coronavirus-covid-19#communicating-with-parents-carers-and-pupils](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/safeguarding-and-remote-education-during-coronavirus-covid-19#communicating-with-parents-carers-and-pupils).
