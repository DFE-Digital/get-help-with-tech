## Introduction
Since the start of the pandemic, the government has distributed over 1.35 million 
laptops and tablets to schools, trusts, local authorities and further education
providers for disadvantaged children and young people.

It was announced on 22 October that the Get help with technology (GHwT) service 
will provide an additional 500,000 laptops and tablets for children and young people 
throughout autumn and winter 2021/22 to support their education and help keep
them connected. Up to 6,000 of these laptops will be available for children entering
the UK from Afghanistan under Operation Warm Welcome. Schools and colleges will
be able to order devices for these children until February 2022.

These laptops and tablets are owned by schools, trusts, local authorities or further 
education providers who can lend them to eligible children and young people.

## Eligibility
All children in years 3&ndash;13 or 16 to 19 education who have arrived in the UK under
Operation Warm Welcome and joined your school this academic year are eligible. A 
school or college can order one device for each eligible child.

## Ordering
To order, sign in to your account at 
[Get help with technology](/), 
then select &lsquo;Order 
devices and routers&rsquo;. There&rsquo;s a link to the order form under the heading &lsquo;Operation 
Warm Welcome&rsquo;.

The form will request information, including device numbers required, device type,
and age of pupils. Schools or colleges should order devices for children they expect
to be staying in their school for at least the remainder of the term.

During the ordering process, schools will be asked to fill out a declaration confirming that:

* these devices will be provided only to eligible children
* the school will undertake safeguarding duties, and record the arrangements 
  they have with families.

This information will then be verified. Schools may later be asked to provide 
evidence of how they&rsquo;ve distributed devices consistent with our agreement.

Schools may also be able to find support through other organisations that work with 
children and young people from Afghanistan, such as the 
[Barnardo&rsquo;s device and connectivity initiative](https://www.barnardos.org.uk/news/vodafone-and-barnardos-issue-new-appeal-devices-help-afghan-refugees).

## Who owns the devices?

Ownership of laptops and tablets is transferred from the
Department for Education (DfE) to the academy trusts, schools, colleges and further 
education institutions that have received them.

Device owners are able to choose how and when to temporarily lend, or permanently 
give, devices to children and young people in need, or to other organisations.

DfE expects organisations to decide how best to make devices available to
disadvantaged children and young people so they can access remote education, 
face-to-face learning and online social care when needed. Find out more about 
[who owns the devices](/devices/device-distribution-and-ownership).

## Record keeping

Schools and colleges should keep a record of agreements between their 
organisation and families, a record of who each device has gone to, and whether it
has been gifted, lent or returned. DfE may request this information to verify 
compliance with the declaration filled in when ordering devices.

## Safeguarding

Local authorities, academy trusts, schools, colleges and further education institutions 
all have a responsibility to keep children and young people safe online.

This applies where laptops and tablets are provided through the Get help with
technology programme, as well as any new or refurbished devices received through
donations.

Laptops and tablets ordered from October 2021 onwards are delivered with factory 
settings and do not have any DfE-managed software installed. Device owners are
responsible for ensuring appropriate content filters and device management systems
are in place.

For devices delivered in academic year 2021/22, we are making a grant available to 
contribute towards the technical support costs of setting up devices received through 
GHwT. [Find out more about these grants, including the eligibility criteria](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/get-help-with-technology-conditions-of-internet-access-and-device-grants).

## English as an additional language

When setting up a device, consider the specific child&rsquo;s needs such as native
language. You can install language packs during the setup process, for example.

Some devices, such as Windows tablets and iPads, will be able to accommodate
onscreen keyboards for different languages. For physical keyboards, there are 
alternative keyboard layout keyboards, or overlay stickers.

## What if a child moves to another setting?

We are aware that families arriving under Operation Warm Welcome may relocate
within the UK, with the children moving to another school or college.

It&rsquo;s up to your organisation to decide whether to give a device to a child, transfer 
ownership to the new school, or request the device back. You should carefully 
consider the individual&rsquo;s needs when making this decision.

If you choose to give a device to a child leaving your educational setting, you should 
make sure that it&rsquo;ll remain usable once the child has left.

Where ownership of a device transfers to the child&rsquo;s new school or college, it&rsquo;s for
you to agree the details of the transfer with the new school. You may want to return 
the device to factory settings. Tell the new school what changes have been made, so
it can be appropriately set up and secured again.

If you request the device back from the child, you should let them know that they can
request a device from their new school.

In all cases, but particularly where a child is moving school or college, you should
encourage pupils to store their work in the cloud. This will allow a child to access
their previous schoolwork after they&rsquo;ve left an educational setting. If settings do not 
use cloud-based technology, they should consider alternative ways to ensure pupils 
have access to their schoolwork if they move settings.

[moving your school to the cloud](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/moving-your-school-to-the-cloud/moving-your-school-to-the-cloud).

## Lost, stolen or sold devices

You should make clear to recipients of devices that it&rsquo;s unlawful for any lent device to
be sold by a student or their family. If a lent device is lost, stolen or sold, or where 
recall is not possible, you should follow any existing procedures you have for lost, 
stolen or missing devices.

If you have any safeguarding concerns relating to a device you suspect has been 
lost, stolen or sold, you should 
[contact us](/get-support).
