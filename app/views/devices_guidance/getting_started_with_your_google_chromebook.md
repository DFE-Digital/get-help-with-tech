## How to turn it on

1.  Plug in your device to the mains, using the power supply and charger in the box
2.  Press the ‘On’ button

## Connect to Wi-Fi

Your device needs to access a Wi-Fi network before you can use the internet.

If you’ve been given a 4G router to access the internet, look in its box to find the name of the network and the password you’ll need. 

If you’re using your own Wi-Fi to access the internet,  then connect using the same network and password as you would with other devices, such as a mobile phone.

You can start using your Chromebook once you’re connected to a Wi-Fi network. 

For pupils and students, your school, college or further education institution will let you know which resources you should use. For care leavers, and children and families with a social worker, your local authority will let you know how you can use your Chromebook to get the services you need.

## Staying safe online

Your Google Chromebook should have safeguarding settings applied to keep you safe online.

This means you won’t be able to use this device to access any inappropriate content.

If you’re blocked from viewing something you think you need for your education, work or wellbeing, get in touch with your school or local authority contact.

If you’re worried that your child is accessing harmful content on any device, find out [where to go to receive support and advice](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/safeguarding-and-remote-education-during-coronavirus-covid-19#communicating-with-parents-carers-and-pupils).

If a child is worried or needs support, they can call [Childline](https://www.childline.org.uk/toolbox/for-me/) (0800 1111) or download their ‘For Me’ app.

If your child has a social worker, you should contact your local authority if you have any concerns about your child’s safety or wellbeing.
