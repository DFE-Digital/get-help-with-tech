User guidance included in device box:

### Turn it on

1.  Plug in your device to the mains, using the power supply and charger in the box.
2.  Press the ‘On’ button.

### Connect to Wi-Fi

Your device needs to access a Wi-Fi network before you can use the internet.

### Follow the instructions on the screen.

**Note:** If you’ve been given a 4G router, look in its box to find the name of the network and the password you’ll need. If you’re using your own Wi-Fi then connect using the same network and password as you would with other devices, such as a mobile phone.

### You’re ready to get online

You can start using your Chromebook once you’re connected to a Wi-Fi network. For pupils, your school will let you know which resources you should use. For children and families with a social worker and care leavers, your local authority will be in touch about how you can use your Chromebook to get the services you need.

### Staying safe online

Your Google Chromebook should have safeguarding settings applied to keep you safe online.

This means you won’t be able to use this device to access any inappropriate content.
