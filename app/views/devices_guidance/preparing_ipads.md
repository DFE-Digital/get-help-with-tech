This guidance is written with reference to iPads provided through the Get help with technology programme. It also applies to any new or refurbished devices a school or college has received through donations. Further information about [erasing data from donated devices](https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/blog-post/erasing-data-from-donated-devices) is available from the National Cyber Security Centre.

## What you get

Each iPad bundle contains:

* 10 inch iPad with 32GB storage and a headphone port
* USB charging cable
* 3-point power adapter
* a lightly padded neoprene sleeve

See the [full device specification](/devices/device-specification). 
 
The simple protective sleeve you receive is ideal for storing the device.

The child or young person will need to take the device out of the sleeve to use it, so you may want to consider purchasing rigid iPad cases for in-use protection.

## User guidance for iPads

Apple provide easy-to-follow instructions in the box for users. What users can do on their iPads depends on how you have set them up in Apple School Manager. 

See general [user guidance](https://support.apple.com/guide/ipad/turn-on-and-set-up-ipad995bb83d/ipados) on how to turn on and set up iPads.


## Local authorities: Managing security settings

This guidance is for the small number of local authorities who received iPads with Jamf security settings in the 2020 summer term.

These security settings expire in July 2021 – see your original order to find the specific date. After this, the iPads will be unprotected and users will have unrestricted access to all content on the internet. It is your responsibility to ensure users of the iPads are appropriately safeguarded.
