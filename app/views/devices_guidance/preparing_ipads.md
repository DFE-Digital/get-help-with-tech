This guidance is for iPads provided through the Get help with technology programme. It
also applies to any new or refurbished devices a school or college has received through
donations. Further information about
[erasing data from donated devices](https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/blog-post/erasing-data-from-donated-devices)
is available from
the National Cyber Security Centre.

## About iPad bundles

Each iPad bundle contains:

* 10 inch iPad with 32GB storage and a headphone port
* USB charging cable
* 3-point power adapter
* a lightly padded neoprene sleeve (sleeves are packaged separately and may arrive
on a different day to the iPads).

See the [full device specification](/devices/device-specification).

Although the sleeves offer some protection, it&rsquo;s a good idea to purchase rigid  cases for the
iPads to protect the devices and reduce the risk of accidental damage.

## Finding your Apple School Manager (ASM) Organisation ID

When you order iPads we ask for your Apple School Manager (ASM). If you need to find
this, you can follow these steps:

1. Log in to Apple School Manager.
1. Select &lsquo;Settings&rsquo;, then select &lsquo;Enrolment Information&rsquo;.
1. Look for your Organisation ID in the Enrolment Information pane.

Find out [how to enrol in Apple School Manager](https://support.apple.com/en-gb/guide/apple-school-manager/apd402206497/web).

## Enrol DfE iPads in ASM using the reseller ID

You need to enter the reseller ID in Apple School Manager (ASM) before you can enrol the
iPads in ASM to manage them.

1. Go to [school.apple.com](https://school.apple.com).
1. Enter your ASM ID to login.
1. Select &lsquo;Settings&rsquo; in the bottom left-hand corner.
1. Select &lsquo;Device Management Settings&rsquo;.
1. In the &lsquo;Customer Numbers&rsquo; section in the right-hand pane select &lsquo;Edit&rsquo;.
1. Select &lsquo;Reseller Number&rsquo; from the drop down box.
1. Enter the Reseller ID. You&rsquo;ll find this in the &lsquo;Description&rsquo; section of the delivery note you.
received with your Apple iPads. It will look like this: COK:DFE8:APPLE IPAD 10.2 XXXXXXX (the last 7 digits are your Reseller ID). If you have any problems locating the
Reseller ID, contact us and we&rsquo;ll confirm it.
1. Once the number has been verified select &lsquo;Done&rsquo;.

Itâ€™ll usually take 2 days from receipt of your iPads for the devices to appear in your ASM.
