This guidance is for iPads provided through the Get help with 
technology programme. It also applies to any new or refurbished devices a school or
college has received through donations. Further information about [erasing data from donated devices](https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/blog-post/erasing-data-from-donated-devices) 
is available from the National Cyber Security Centre.

## About iPad bundles

Each iPad bundle contained:

* 10 inch iPad with 32GB storage and a headphone port
* USB charging cable
* 3-point power adapter
* a lightly padded neoprene sleeve

See the [full device specification](/devices/device-specification). 
 
The protective sleeve is ideal for storing the device
but it&rsquo;s worth thinking about buying rigid 
iPad cases.

## Local authorities: managing security settings

This guidance is for the small number of local authorities who received iPads with Jamf 
security settings in the 2020 summer term.

These security settings expired in July 2021 &ndash; see your original order to find the specific
date. Beyond that date, 
it&rsquo;s your responsibility to put restrictions in
place to make sure users are protected.
