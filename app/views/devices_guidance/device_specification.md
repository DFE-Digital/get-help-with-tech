When [placing an order](/), schools, colleges, further education institutions, academy trusts and local authorities (LAs) can choose (depending on availability) from:

* Microsoft Windows laptops
* Google Chromebooks

You can find out if any types of device are out of stock by [signing in to the Get help with technology service](/sign-in). The information is also available on the TechSource ordering website.

Apple iPads and Microsoft Windows tablets are now permanently out of stock. For information on setting up and managing tablets you've already received, [see our guidance](/devices).

## Before you order

We may need some technical information from you before you can order, so we recommend choosing the types of devices and settings you want before you’re invited to order.

## Microsoft Windows laptops

When you order you’ll be asked whether or not you want to have DfE settings installed.

#### Not having DfE settings installed (temporarily out of stock)

These ‘DfE Standard’ devices are provided with factory settings. Your school, trust or LA should configure them at your own cost before lending them to pupils. This means installing preferred safeguarding measures and bringing them into an existing device management framework.

#### DfE settings installed (in stock)

These ‘DfE Restricted’ devices are set up with content filtering and MDM software before delivery. They’re not configurable, and there are limitations on downloading software and changing strict content filters that may prevent some browsers and conferencing tools from functioning. These settings expire on 30 September 2021, <a class="govuk-link" href="/devices/preparing-microsoft-windows-laptops-and-tablets#reconfigure-your-devices">read our guidance on how to reset devices and apply your own security settings to make them safe for pupils and students to use</a>.

Read more information about <a class="govuk-link" href="/devices/preparing-microsoft-windows-laptops-and-tablets">preparing Microsoft devices</a> for pupils, including how to access the local admin and BIOS passwords you’ll need to reset devices.

All devices provided before September 2020 were delivered with safeguarding and mobile device management (MDM) software installed. You can <a class="govuk-link" href="/devices/preparing-microsoft-windows-laptops-and-tablets#preparing-laptops-and-tablets-ordered-with-dfe-settings-installed">find out when that software expires</a> in our guidance.

[Find the technical specifications for Microsoft Windows laptops](#minimum-specifications) in the table below.

## Google Chromebooks (in stock)

A web-filtering solution called Cisco Umbrella is included free of charge until 30 September 2021, if you wish to use it. If you decide not to use Cisco Umbrella, or you continue using the Chromebooks once Cisco Umbrella has expired, DfE will no longer support these devices. It’s your responsibility to avoid risks to the online safety of the children and young people you’re providing devices to. [Find out more about Cisco Umbrella](https://get-help-with-tech.education.gov.uk/devices/preparing-chromebooks#securing-your-chromebooks) in our guidance.

### Ordering Chromebooks for state-funded schools, colleges or further education institutions

You need to [sign in to the Get help with technology service](/sign-in) and give the following information before you can order Google Chromebooks:

* the educational setting's Google domain for Google Workspace for Education Fundamentals (formerly G Suite for Education) - for example 'school.co.uk'
* a recovery email address, which must be on a different domain to the educational setting's domain - for example, if the registered domain is ‘school.co.uk’, the recovery email cannot be ‘recovery@school.co.uk’

If you’re not sure how to find this information, you should ask your IT support for help.

If the school you’re ordering for does not currently use an education platform, you can <a class="govuk-link" href="/digital-platforms">apply for DfE-funded support to get access to either Google Workspace for Education Fundamentals or Microsoft 365 Education</a>.

### Ordering Chromebooks for LA-funded pupils in independent special schools or alternative provision

You’ll be asked if you want to order Google Chromebooks when you [sign in to the Get help with technology service](https://get-help-with-tech.education.gov.uk/sign-in). You should answer ‘Yes’.

After you order you’ll get an email asking if you want us to supply Chrome Education Upgrades (Chromebook licenses). An educational setting will need a license to enrol the device in their Google Admin console. This gives them options to manage and secure the device.

Reply to the email you receive to request licenses. You'll need to provide the following information for each pupil’s educational setting:

* the educational setting's Google domain for Google Workspace for Education Fundamentals (formerly G Suite for Education) - for example 'school.co.uk'
* a recovery email address, which must be on a different domain to the educational setting's domain - for example, if the registered domain is 'school.co.uk', the recovery email cannot be 'recovery@school.co.uk'

The educational setting's IT support should be able to give you this.

Alternatively, your LA can choose to [set up and manage a Google domain](https://get-help-with-tech.education.gov.uk/devices/google-domain-for-care-leavers-and-children-with-social-worker).

If you do not request licenses, your Chromebooks will be delivered with factory settings. Cisco Umbrella web filtering will not be installed. Your LA, or the education setting you lend or give the devices to, will be responsible for [installing safeguarding and security settings](https://get-help-with-tech.education.gov.uk/devices/preparing-chromebooks#securing-your-chromebooks) before they’re distributed to pupils. 

### Ordering Chromebooks for care leavers

You’ll be asked if you want to order Google Chromebooks when you [sign in to the Get help with technology service](https://get-help-with-tech.education.gov.uk/sign-in). You should answer ‘Yes’. 

If a care leaver is in education, their educational setting will need a Chrome Education Upgrade (Chromebook license) to enrol the device in their Google Admin console (if they have one). To request a license, follow the steps listed above for LA-funded pupils in independent special schools or alternative provision.

If you’re ordering for a care leaver who is not in education, and you cannot provide Google Workspace for Education details for them, you can choose to:

* order a Windows laptop instead
* [set up and manage a Google domain](https://get-help-with-tech.education.gov.uk/devices/google-domain-for-care-leavers-and-children-with-social-worker)
* distribute the device unsecured - [read our guidance on your safeguarding responsibilities before making this choice](https://get-help-with-tech.education.gov.uk/devices/safeguarding-for-device-users)
