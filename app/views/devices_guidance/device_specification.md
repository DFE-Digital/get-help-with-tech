## Laptops and tablets provided from October 2021 onwards

The Get help with technology programme is providing Windows laptops and tablets, 
Google Chromebooks and Apple iPads.

Devices are provided with factory settings and do not include content filtering and
safeguarding software. Your organisation will need to configure them at your own cost
before lending them to children and young people. This means installing your preferred
safeguarding measures and bringing them into an existing device management framework
to ensure the devices are safe for children to use.

Devices provided from <span class="app-no-wrap">October 2021</span> onwards meet the following minimum technical specifications:

### Education software

Microsoft Windows devices do not have Microsoft 365 (formerly Office 365) applications 
installed, but users will be able to use Microsoft 365 online if their school has an active
subscription. A child or young person not in school (such as a care leaver) can make use
of their own preferred online system.

Schools can 
[apply for government funding to get set up on Microsoft 365 Education](/digital-platforms). 
Microsoft 365 Education includes Microsoft Word, Excel and Powerpoint as well as many 
mobile device management features.

A Chrome Education Upgrade is offered with every Google Chromebook.

### Pre-issued devices

In addition to brand new devices, we may offer &lsquo;pre-issued&rsquo; devices. These meet the
minimum technical specifications and have been distributed as part of the Get help with
technology programme, then returned. They may or may not have been used, and may
have residual asset labels, external scratches, smart water application, etching or writing
on the exterior of the device.

Our delivery partner completes the following quality checks for each used device:

* it is visually inspected, and where possible any labels (such as asset tags) are removed
* it switches on and powers up
* the screen, CPU, RAM and HDD are tested
* the device is reset

Pre-issued devices come with any remaining manufacturer&rsquo;s warranty.

## Laptops and tablets provided before October 2021

Previously, organisations could choose to have Windows devices delivered as &lsquo;standard&rsquo;, 
or they could opt for devices with &lsquo;DfE settings installed&rsquo;. This included content filtering and
mobile device management software:

* Microsoft Intune &ndash; device management software that prevents users from installing
unauthorised software or making changes to files and settings
* Cisco Umbrella &ndash; content filtering software that blocks a range of illegal and 
inappropriate content and limits searching to the &lsquo;Safe Search&rsquo; provided by popular
search engines

This software was due to expire on <span class="app-no-wrap">30 September 2021</span>. To ensure devices remain safe for
children and young people to use, we&rsquo;ve extended licences until <span class="app-no-wrap">30 September 2022</span>. 
You&rsquo;re still required to 
[reset Windows devices and apply your own safeguarding settings](/devices/guide-to-resetting-windows-laptops-and-tablets)
as soon as possible.

Chromebooks came with the option of using a web filtering solution called Cisco Umbrella
free of charge. Licences were due to expire on <span class="app-no-wrap">30 September 2021</span> and, although we&rsquo;ve
extended licences until <span class="app-no-wrap">30 September 2022</span>, you are encouraged to 
[remove Cisco Umbrella from Chromebooks](/devices/remove-dfe-provided-cisco-umbrella-from-chromebooks)
and put your own web filtering in place as soon as possible.
