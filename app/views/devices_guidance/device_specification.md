## Microsoft Windows laptops

From September 2020, you were offered a choice of settings.

#### Not having DfE settings installed

These ‘DfE Standard’ Windows devices were provided with factory settings. Your school, trust or LA should configure them at your own cost before lending them to pupils. This means installing preferred safeguarding measures and bringing them into an existing device management framework.

#### DfE settings installed

These ‘DfE Restricted’ Windows devices were set up with content filtering and MDM software before delivery. They’re not configurable, and there are limitations on downloading software and changing strict content filters that may prevent some browsers and conferencing tools from functioning. These settings expire on 30 September 2021. Read our guidance on [how to reset devices and apply your own security settings](/devices/guide-to-resetting-windows-laptops-and-tablets) to make them safe for pupils and students to use.

Read more information about [preparing Microsoft devices](/devices/preparing-microsoft-windows-laptops-and-tablets) for pupils, including how to access the local admin and BIOS passwords you’ll need to reset devices.

All devices provided before September 2020 were delivered with safeguarding and mobile device management (MDM) software installed. You can [find out when that software expires](/devices/preparing-microsoft-windows-laptops-and-tablets) in our guidance.

## Google Chromebooks

A web-filtering solution called Cisco Umbrella was included free of charge until 30 September 2021, if you wish to use it. If you decide not to use Cisco Umbrella, or you continue using the Chromebooks once Cisco Umbrella has expired, DfE will no longer support these devices. It’s your responsibility to avoid risks to the online safety of the children and young people you’re providing devices to. [Find out more about Cisco Umbrella](https://get-help-with-tech.education.gov.uk/devices/preparing-chromebooks#securing-your-chromebooks) in our guidance.

A Chrome Education Upgrade (Chromebook license) was offered with every device.

## iPads and Windows tablets

### Pre-issued devices

In addition to brand new devices, we offered ‘pre-issued’ devices too. These had been distributed as part of the Get help with technology programme, and then returned. They may or may not have been used.

Our delivery partner completed the following quality checks for each used device:

* it was visually inspected, and where possible any labels (such as asset tags) were removed
* it switched on and powered up
* the screen, CPU, RAM and HDD were tested
* the device was reset

These devices met the minimum technical specifications for remote education. They may have residual asset labels, external scratches, smart water application, etching or writing on the exterior of the device.

If devices came with any remaining manufacturer's warranty (this was less than a year).
