Local authorities (LAs) and academy trusts will receive an email from Computacenter inviting them to join the TechSource portal, shortly before ordering opens.  

LAs should order devices for children and young people with a social worker, including Year 10s, preschool children and care leavers. LAs should inform LA maintained schools and academy trusts that the LA will be supplying their devices.

For year 10 pupils without a social worker, the LA orders for pupils in maintained schools, and academy trusts order for pupils in their trust.

## For Chromebook orders

If you're ordering Chromebooks for school children with social care needs, talk to the child's school to ensure the Chromebook will be enrolled on that school's Google domain, if they have one. This is so the child will be able to access their school’s services and remote education. To do this, create a separate order for each school domain including the number of Google devices needed.  

You can set up a LA Google domain for pre-school children, care leavers and any other young people with social care needs who are not linked to a school. [Find out how to set up a Google domain for care leavers and children with a social worker](https://www.computacenter.com/uk/supporting-online-learning-and-safeguarding-technical-guides/preparing-chromebooks/google-domain-for-care-leavers-children-with-social-worker) .  

You’ll be asked to enter a Google domain and ‘Recovery Off- Domain email’ for the Google domain. If you need assistance please speak to your technical contact who should be able to assist with this. Please do not order before exhausting all efforts to find this information from the school / local authority. As a last resort please type “UNKNOWN” however Google Education licences cannot be provided to you. We will report this action to the DfE as it is a security risk.

For safe use, children and young people need their Chromebooks to be linked to a Google domain before they can use them. You can find out more about [how to enrol Google Chromebooks](/devices/preparing-chromebooks).

## How to order

1.  Complete the online form sent from Computacenter. You’ll be asked to nominate up to 5 colleagues who can also order on your behalf.
2.  Computacenter will send the colleagues you nominated, an email inviting you to register with TechSource, its online store. Please register.
3.  Wait for Computacenter to notify you that your devices are available. You can then order them on the TechSource website. It may take a few weeks before your devices are available to order. Please do not order more devices than you were allocated or your order will be rejected.
4.  LAs responsible for both social care orders and education orders will have 2 TechSource accounts – one for each type of order. Make sure you’re signed in to the correct account by checking the account name indicated at the top right of the TechSource webpage.
5.  You will receive the devices within 5 working days of submitting your order. Microsoft devices, Google Chromebooks and 4G wireless routers will arrive in separate deliveries. We will email the delivery contact the evening before each delivery.

If you have not received any of the emails needed to complete the steps above, please email [COVID.Technology@education.gov.uk](mailto:COVID.Technology@education.gov.uk).

The DfE considered all allocation queries raised by local authorities and academy trusts, and reviewed the submitted evidence against the initial allocation. The department then compared those queries to similar requests it received nationwide, and balanced it against the total number of devices available.
