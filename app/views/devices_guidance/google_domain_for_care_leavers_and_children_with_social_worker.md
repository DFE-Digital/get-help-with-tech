Find out how to set up a domain to manage Google Chromebooks for families of pre-school aged children with a social worker and care leavers who aren’t associated with a school.

If the child or young person attends a school, you should use their Google domain if possible so that they can access their school’s services and remote education. If they don’t have a school, or if their school doesn't have a Google domain and doesn’t intend to apply for one, you should follow these instructions.

You need to:

* Sign up for G Suite for Education
* Verify domain ownership
* Fast-track approval

## Sign up for G Suite for Education

Sign up for [G Suite for Education](https://edu.google.com/products/gsuite-for-education/?modal_active=none)

During the sign-up process, you’ll be asked to choose your [primary domain](https://support.google.com/a/answer/182080?hl=en&ref_topic=29190).

* Choose a domain to which you have admin access (for example, where you can change DNS records).
* Recommended: You can buy a domain, if you don’t already have one, during the sign-up process. If you buy a domain, you won’t need to verify it in the next step.

After completing the sign-up process, you’ll be given a 14-day trial of G Suite for Education (with a 10 user limit during the trial period).

## Verify domain ownership

[Verify your domain](https://support.google.com/a/answer/60216?hl=en) to ensure that no one else is using your domain for Google services without your permission. This requires adding either a TXT or MX verification record to your DNS records.

## Fast-track approval

Email [COVID.TECHNOLOGY@education.gov.uk](mailto:COVID.TECHNOLOGY@education.gov.uk) with your domain to get <span class="app-no-wrap">fast-tracked</span> for approval (this process typically takes up to 14 days, but we can reduce to less than 24 hours).
