Find out how to set up a domain to manage Google Chromebooks for families of children 
with a social worker and care leavers who are not associated with a school.

If the child or young person attends a school, you should use their Google domain if 
possible so that they can access their school&rsquo;s services and remote education. If they do
not have a school, or if their school does not have a Google domain and does not intend to 
apply for one, you should follow these instructions.

You need to:

* sign up for Google Workspace for Education Fundamentals (formerly G&nbsp;Suite for Education)
* verify domain ownership.

Sign up for [Google Workspace for Education Fundamentals](https://edu.google.com/products/workspace-for-education/).

During the sign-up process, you&rsquo;ll be asked to choose your 
[primary domain](https://support.google.com/a/answer/182080?hl=en&ref_topic=29190).

* Choose a domain to which you have admin access (for example, where you can 
change DNS records).
* Recommended: You can buy a domain, if you do not already have one, during the
sign-up process. If you buy a domain, you will not need to verify it in the next step.

After completing the sign-up process, you&rsquo;ll be given a 14-day trial of Google Workspace 
for Education Fundamentals (with a 10-user limit during the trial period).

## Verify domain ownership

[Verify your domain](https://support.google.com/a/answer/60216?hl=en) 
to ensure that no one else is using your domain for Google services
without your permission. This requires adding either a TXT or MX verification record to
your DNS records.
