## When devices will be delivered

Local authorities (LAs) will first receive devices to support care leavers and vulnerable young people who have social workers. The Department for Education will begin processing orders for disadvantaged year 10 children in June.

Devices will be delivered within 5 days of orders being placed. 

We will email the person nominated as your delivery contact when the order has been despatched. The delivery contact should check their email spam folder for messages during the expected delivery window.

We will also email the technical contact with a list of serial numbers for your devices.

If you have ordered a mix of devices (some Microsoft based laptops, some tablets and some Google Chromebooks, for example) you’ll receive each type of device as a separate delivery. All devices should arrive within 5 standard working days of placing your order.

If your order has not arrived after 5 standard working days, please email [DepartmentforEducation@computacenter.com](mailto:DepartmentforEducation@computacenter.com) to notify us, making sure you include your order number.

## Where devices will be delivered to

Your devices will be delivered to the address specified in your order. The person named in the order as authorised to receive the delivery will need to be present.

Google Chromebooks, Microsoft Windows devices and 4G routers will arrive in separate deliveries. Please see [when devices will be delivered](#when-devices-will-be-delivered) for more information.

## Replacing a faulty device

If you find that a device is not working within 3 days of receiving it, we’ll repair or replace it. To arrange this, you need to:

1.  Email [DepartmentforEducation@computacenter.com](mailto:DepartmentforEducation@computacenter.com) with your order number and the Serial number on the device that is not working. (IMEI number for 4G Wireless routers)
2.  Insure the item(s) and make sure you write down the postal or courier tracking number before sending it.
3.  Send the item(s) back to us when we ask you to.

If you find that a device is faulty more than 3 days after receiving it, it will be covered under a ‘Return to Base’ warranty. Please follow the return instructions issued by the manufacturer of the device, which will be included in the box.

Please note that SIMs will not work on the day you receive the 4G wireless routers because they will not be activated until the following day. The data allowance will start from this point and will remain active for 6 months. You should wait until the day after you receive the 4G wireless routers before loaning the devices to users.

If your 4G wireless router will not start, please check that it is fully charged.

## Reporting a missing device

If you receive the wrong items or are missing any devices from your delivery, please email [DepartmentforEducation@computacenter.com](mailto:DepartmentforEducation@computacenter.com) and include your order number.
