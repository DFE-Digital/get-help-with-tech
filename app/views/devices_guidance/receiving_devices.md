## When devices will be delivered

Local authorities (LAs) will first receive devices to support care leavers and vulnerable young people who have social workers. The Department for Education will begin processing orders for disadvantaged year 10 children in June.

Devices will be delivered within 5 days of orders being placed. 

We will email the person nominated as your delivery contact when the order has been despatched. The delivery contact should check their email spam folder for messages during the expected delivery window.

We will also email the technical contact with a list of serial numbers for your devices.

If you have ordered a mix of devices (some Microsoft based laptops, some tablets and some Google Chromebooks, for example) you’ll receive each type of device as a separate delivery. All devices should arrive within 5 standard working days of placing your order.

If your order has not arrived after 5 standard working days, please email [DepartmentforEducation@computacenter.com](mailto:DepartmentforEducation@computacenter.com) to notify us, making sure you include your order number.

## Where devices will be delivered to

Your devices will be delivered to the address specified in your order. The person named in the order as authorised to receive the delivery will need to be present.

Google Chromebooks, Microsoft Windows devices and 4G routers will arrive in separate deliveries. Please see [when devices will be delivered](#when-devices-will-be-delivered) for more information.

## Replacing a faulty device

The [Computacenter support portal](https://computacenterprod.service-now.com/dfe) allows local authorities and academy trusts to request replacement devices and monitor the progress of their orders.

If you work within social care or a school, please report faulty devices to your local authority or academy trust so they can manage the process of requesting a replacement.

### If a device is not working when you receive it 

We’ll repair or replace it under our warranty support service. We’ll provide you with a replacement device within 2 working days of returning a device. This is significantly faster than requesting a replacement through the manufacturer’s warranty process.

* For Microsoft and Chromebook devices, our warranty support is available for faults reported before 19 December 2020
* For 4G routers, our warranty support is available for faults reported within 5 days of receiving your device

If you find a fault within this initial period, you need to:

* log in to the [Computacenter support portal](https://computacenterprod.service-now.com/dfe) – access details have been sent to the key contact for your organisation nominated during the application process. The key contact can nominate up to 4 additional people to access the support portal through the ‘Support Contact Registration’ option. A ‘forgot password’ option is available on the login screen if needed.
* navigate to the ‘Raise Support Request’ section and follow the on-screen instructions 
* send the item(s), including any power chargers, following the instructions provided within the support portal 
* make sure you insure the item(s) and write down the postal or courier tracking number before sending

If you have any issues accessing or using the support portal, please email [DepartmentforEducation@computacenter.com](mailto:DepartmentforEducation@computacenter.com) with your order tracking number.

When returning a device, you should be aware that:

* if a device is returned with a fault that’s not covered by the manufacturer’s warranty, you’ll be charged £220 for the repair. A list of faults that are not covered is available in the support portal within the ‘How to request a warranty replacement’ article, along with information on ‘How to triage hardware issues’
* if you return a device and no fault is found, or return a device that was not provided as part of this offer, you’ll be charged £108 per device for handling plus:

     * £208.29 for a replacement Windows laptop device
     * £154.40 for a replacement Windows tablet device
     * £235.62 for a replacement Chromebook 
     
* if you fail to include the original power charger along with your returned device you’ll be charged up to £35 per replacement
* if you fail to meet the courier collecting your faulty device(s) within 30 minutes of the agreed time, you’ll incur a charge of £81 per visit

All costs include courier charges but exclude VAT.

### If a device develops a fault after 19 December 2020

Devices come with a 12-month manufacturer’s warranty that will expire between May and July 2021, depending on when your device was delivered to us. Please note, this will be earlier than the date it was received by you.

If you find a fault with the device after the initial warranty support service period ends, please follow the return instructions issued by the manufacturer of the device, which will be included in the box.

You can contact the manufacturer to ask for an extension to the 12-month manufacturer’s warranty. The management and associated costs of this will be the responsibility of the local authorities and trusts who own the devices.

Please note that SIMs will not work on the day you receive the 4G wireless routers because they will not be activated until the following day. The data allowance will start from this point and will remain active for 6 months. You should wait until the day after you receive the 4G wireless routers before loaning the devices to users.

If your 4G wireless router will not start, please check that it is fully charged.

## Reporting a missing device

If you receive the wrong items or are missing any devices from your delivery, please email [DepartmentforEducation@computacenter.com](mailto:DepartmentforEducation@computacenter.com) and include your order number.
