## Who owns the devices

For laptops, tablets and connectivity devices available for schools, academy trusts and local authorities from September 2020:

* All devices will be fully owned by the schools or academy trusts who receive them
* It will be the responsibility of the school to loan the devices to those who need them.

For laptops, tablets and 4G wireless routers provided between May and July 2020:

* Local authorities (LAs) and academy trusts own the devices (and the licenses) they received
They can choose to transfer ownership to schools
* They can choose to transfer ownership to schools
* This means devices can continue to support children and young peopleâ€™s education and online access to social care services.

Schools, LAs and academy trusts can choose to:

* loan devices directly to families, children and young people
* gift devices to care leavers

[Guidance on safe internet use](https://www.saferinternet.org.uk/) should be provided when devices are loaned or gifted.

LAs and academy trusts should avoid transferring ownership directly to children and families. This helps ensure that safeguarding solutions like web filtering remain in place.

## Distributing devices

Laptops, tablets and 4G wireless routers will be delivered directly to schools or local authorities named in the order.  Read guidance on [how to order](/devices/how-to-order) for more information on the delivery process.

Organisations are responsible for deciding how they deliver devices. For example, they can:

* arrange for them to be collected by families from school
* organise for them to be delivered to the homes of children and care leavers
* arrange for schools to deliver them
* use local organisations, such as those supporting care leavers

All distribution and return of loaned devices should be done in accordance with [social distancing guidelines](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/staying-alert-and-safe-social-distancing), and any [social distancing guidelines relevant to your local area](https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/local-restrictions-areas-with-an-outbreak-of-coronavirus-covid-19).

## Loan agreements

LAs, academy trusts and schools could consider using loan agreements when distributing devices to children and young people. This agreement could set out the terms and conditions of the loan, including who is responsible for what.

[The Key for School Leaders](https://covid19.thekeysupport.com/covid-19/deliver-remote-learning/make-tech-work-you/loaning-it-equipment-pupils-and-staff/#section-1) has templates and examples of how to set these up.

## Labelling or tagging devices

Laptops, tablets and 4G wireless routers will not be tagged or labelled when they are delivered. LAs and trusts are responsible for implementing their own security and tracking methods.
