## When you get your laptop or tablet

### How to turn it on

1.   Plug in your device to the mains, using the power supply and charger in the box.
2.   Press the ‘On’ button.

#### Log in

You should see a screen that says “localuser”, and your desktop screen will automatically open.

If you see a screen that says “.\\localadmin” and tells you that the username or password is incorrect, press “OK” or enter (↵).

#### Follow these steps:

*   Change the username in the top box from “.\\localadmin” to “.\\localuser” (it’s important to include the “.” dot and “\\” backslash)
*   Do not enter a password (unless you have already set one)
*   Press return
*   You should see a screen that says “localuser”, and your desktop screen will automatically open

If you have set a password that you’ve forgotten, you’ll need to ask your technical contact to reset it for you. If you’re not sure who that is, please ask the person or school that gave you the laptop or tablet.

### Connect to Wi-Fi

Your laptop or tablet needs to access a Wi-Fi network before you can use the internet.

1. Click the Network icon on the taskbar. If you don’t see one of these network icons, click the **"^"** symbol and you should see it there.
2. Choose your Wi-Fi network, then select **"Connect"**.
3. Type your network password, and then select **"Next"**.
4. You should choose **"No"** when asked if you want your device to be discoverable on the Wi-Fi network.

**Note:** If you’ve been given a 4G router, look in its box to find the name of the network and the password you’ll need. If you’re using your own Wi-Fi then connect using the same network and password as you would with other devices, such as a mobile phone.

## You’re ready to get online

You can start using your laptop or tablet once you’re connected to a Wi-Fi network. Your school and/or local authority will let you know which resources you should use.

## Logging back into the operating system

The devices have no passwords set up. If you’ve logged out of the operating system, you can log back in with the username “.\\localuser”. Type the username carefully – the .\\ before localuser is part of the username.

## Staying safe online

All Microsoft Windows devices registered to the DfE have safeguarding settings applied to keep you safe online.

This means you will not be able to use the laptop or tablet to access any inappropriate content.

If you’re blocked from viewing something you think you need for your education, work or wellbeing, please get in touch with your school or local authority contact to let them know.


If you’re worried that your child is accessing harmful content on any device, you can [find support and advice at GOV.UK](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/safeguarding-and-remote-education-during-coronavirus-covid-19).

If your child is worried or needs support, they can call [Childline](https://www.childline.org.uk/) (0800 1111) or download their ‘For Me’ app.

If your child has a social worker, you should contact your local authority if you have any concerns about your child’s safety or wellbeing.
