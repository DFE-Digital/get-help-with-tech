## Ordering devices for schools, colleges, academy trusts and local authorities from September 2020

In the event of a disruption to face-to-face education at schools or colleges due to coronavirus (COVID-19), DfE can provide support to help disadvantaged children and young people who are otherwise unable to access remote education.

Examples of this include disadvantaged children:

* with no digital devices in their household
* whose only available device is a smartphone
* with a single device in their household that's being shared with more than one other family member

This offer applies to maintained schools, pupil referral units, academy trusts and hospital schools, as well as sixth-form colleges and further education providers who have enrolled 14 to 16-year-olds. They’ll receive an allocation of devices to be used to support disadvantaged children if they do not have access to a digital device through other means.

Devices are available for:

* disadvantaged children in years 3 to 11 who do not have access to a device and  whose face-to-face education is disrupted 
* disadvantaged children in any year group who have been [advised to shield](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/guidance-on-shielding-and-protecting-extremely-vulnerable-persons-from-covid-19/guidance-on-shielding-and-protecting-extremely-vulnerable-persons-from-covid-19) because they (or someone they live with) are clinically extremely vulnerable

* a school or college is fully open, but supporting a disadvantaged child living in another area who is unable to attend due to local travel restrictions

Devices can be ordered for disadvantaged children in any year group who have been advised to shield when:

* a school or college supports a [clinically extremely vulnerable child who is shielding](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/guidance-on-shielding-and-protecting-extremely-vulnerable-persons-from-covid-19/guidance-on-shielding-and-protecting-extremely-vulnerable-persons-from-covid-19) following official or medical advice
* a school or college supports a child who has been advised to shield as a member of their household is clinically extremely vulnerable

Devices cannot be ordered when:

* a secondary school or college is limiting attendance by operating a rota model ([tier 2](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/containing-and-managing-local-coronavirus-covid-19-outbreaks/covid-19-contain-framework-a-guide-for-local-decision-makers#tier-2))
* disadvantaged children are [self-isolating because of coronavirus symptoms](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-stay-at-home-guidance/stay-at-home-guidance-for-households-with-possible-coronavirus-covid-19-infection) where this is not part of broader recommendations to a ‘bubble’ or year group
* disadvantaged children are [self-isolating following arrival in the UK](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/coronavirus-covid-19-how-to-self-isolate-when-you-travel-to-the-uk/coronavirus-covid-19-how-to-self-isolate-when-you-travel-to-the-uk)

## Laptops, tablets and 4G wireless routers provided between May and July 2020

DfE has already provided [laptops, tablets and 4G wireless routers](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/laptops-tablets-and-4g-wireless-routers-provided-during-coronavirus-covid-19) to local authorities and academy trusts between May and July 2020. 

These are being distributed to disadvantaged families, children and young adults who did not have access to them through another source, such as their school. 

Laptops and tablets were provided for:

* care leavers
* children and young people aged 0 to 19, or young children’s families, with a social worker
* disadvantaged year 10 pupils in the 2019 to 2020 academic year

4G wireless routers were provided for those who did not have internet access. They were provided for:

* care leavers
* secondary school pupils with a social worker
* disadvantaged year 10 pupils in the 2019 to 2020 academic year

A care leaver is someone aged 16 to 25 who was looked after by a local authority for at least 13 weeks (at least part of which was on or after their 16th birthday), but who is no longer looked after.

These digital devices will help:

* social workers to provide virtual safeguarding and support to the children and families they work with via video conferences, for example 
* children, young people, families and care leavers to access the online services they need to protect their wellbeing
* families and care leavers to avoid social isolation
* children and young people to access remote learning, including year 10 pupils in the 2019 to 2020 academic year
