The Department for Education (DfE) provided [laptops, tablets and 4G wireless routers](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/get-help-with-technology-for-remote-education-during-coronavirus-covid-19) to local authorities and academy trusts between May and July 2020. 

These are being distributed to disadvantaged families, children and young adults who did not have access to them through another source, such as their school. 

These digital devices will help:

* social workers to provide virtual safeguarding and support to the children and families they work with via video conferences, for example 
* children, young people, families and care leavers to access the online services they need to protect their wellbeing
* families and care leavers to avoid social isolation
* children and young people to access remote learning, including year 10 pupils with upcoming GCSE exams

## Who was eligible for the scheme

Devices were provided to local authorities and academy trusts between May and July 2020. 

These are being distributed to disadvantaged families, children and young adults who did not have access to them through another source, such as their school. 

Laptops and tablets have been provided for:

### Laptops and tablets

Laptops and tablets have been provided for:

* care leavers
* children and young people aged 0 to 19, or young children’s families, with a social worker
* disadvantaged year 10 pupils in the 2019 to 2020 academic year


### 4G wireless routers

4G wireless routers have been provided for those who did not have internet access. They’ve been given to:

* care leavers
* secondary school pupils with a social worker
* disadvantaged year 10 pupils in the 2019 to 2020 academic year


A care leaver is someone aged 16 to 25 who was looked after by a local authority for at least 13 weeks (at least part of which was on or after their 16th birthday), but who is no longer looked after.

## How devices were ordered and delivered

All local authorities and academy trusts followed the same steps to apply for and receive devices. The timelines were different for each organisation, because delivery was prioritised in this order:

* care leavers and children with a social worker 
* disadvantaged year 10 children

The application and ordering steps were: 

1. Organisations were asked to complete an online form from the Department for Education’s delivery partner. The form asked the organisation to forecast the number of laptops and tablets they needed, and choose between a Google or Microsoft operating system.
2. Organisations were contacted by the Department for Education to confirm the number of laptops and tablets they were allocated.
3. Organisations were asked to register with the delivery partner’s online system ready to place their order when stock became available.
4. All organisations were invited to place their orders.
