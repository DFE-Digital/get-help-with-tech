To continue using your Huawei router, you must: 

* reset your router before 31 July 2021 - you will be unable to reset it after this date
* insert a different SIM card

Using another SIM card will remove all the content filters. Read our [safeguarding guidance](/devices/safeguarding-for-device-users#safeguarding-resources-for-schools-colleges-parents-and-carers) and information for parents and carers on [keeping children safe online](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/coronavirus-covid-19-keeping-children-safe-online/coronavirus-covid-19-support-for-parents-and-carers-to-keep-children-safe-online).

## Before you start

It will take between 5 and 10 minutes to reset your router.

You’ll need your wifi network name and password. You can find these on a label under the back cover of your router. 

## Reset your Huawei router 

Once you have your wifi network name and password, follow the steps below.

1. Connect your laptop or tablet to the router (read our [Huawei router setup guide](/devices/4g-user-guidance#setting-up-a-huawei-router)).

1. Open a web browser and type [http://192.168.8.1](http://192.168.8.1) in the address bar to get to the Huawei login screen. 

1. Enter the [device login password](Richard to provide) and click ‘log in’.

1. Once connected, you’ll be asked to read and accept the privacy notice and user agreement.    

1. Choose whether you want overnight updates - we recommend you select ‘Enable and continue’.

1. You’ll be asked if you want to change your wifi name and password - we recommend you keep the ones you have. 

1. Choose a new device login password - this should be at least 8 characters and different from your wifi password. Make a note of this password as you may need it later. Select ‘finish’. 

You should now be on the router settings homepage.

  <li>
    You should get an alert about a software update. Check your router is plugged in and select ‘update’.
  </li>
</ol>

Once the update has downloaded it will begin to install automatically - this should take approximately 5 minutes. Router lights may turn on and off during this time. 

You’ll get a notification once the installation is finished. 

## Check your router has been reset 

Connect your laptop or tablet to the router (read our [Huawei router setup guide](/devices/4g-user-guidance#setting-up-a-huawei-router)). Once connected, open a web browser and enter http://192.168.8.1 in the address bar to get to the Huawei login screen.

    You may find that the language has defaulted to non-English. You can change the language back by clicking 
    the dropdown menu named ‘Taal’ in the top-right of the screen and selecting ‘English’.
  </p>
</div>


Enter the new device login password that you changed and click ‘Log in’. If you are redirected to the router settings homepage, your Huawei router is now reset and ready to use.

The SIM card supplied with the router will provide data until 31 July 2021. You can replace this with an alternative SIM card at any time.

If you are unable to access the router settings, you should:

* check if you’ve entered the device login password correctly - this is the one you chose when you reset your router and is different to your wifi password
* repeat the steps again to reset your router
* [contact us](/get-support) if you’re still having difficulties
