## How devices are allocated

Find out about the [additional laptops and tablets available in the 2020 to 2021 academic year](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/get-laptops-for-children-who-cannot-attend-school-due-to-coronavirus-covid-19) for disadvantaged children in certain year groups who are affected by disruption to face to face education at their school, or have been advised to shield because they are clinically extremely vulnerable.

There were a limited number of devices to distribute as part of the first phase of the Get help with technology programme. The most disadvantaged and vulnerable young people and children were prioritised to make sure they can access social care and remote education.

As a local authority or school, the number of devices you’ve been allocated is based on the number of eligible children and young people that:

* you’re responsible for
* the Department for Education (DfE) has estimated do not already have access to a device provided through other means (such as through their school or family)

The DfE considered all allocation queries raised by local authorities and academy trusts, and reviewed the submitted evidence against the initial allocation. The department then compared those queries to similar requests it received nationwide, and balanced it against the total number of devices available. More devices have been provided where there was an evidenced need to support eligible children.
