The number of devices available to order through the service reflects the number of laptops and tablets we estimate are needed by each school. This calculation is based on:

* free school meals data
* an estimate of the number of devices a school already has

Laptops and tablets will be available for further education providers to order in the 2021 spring term. We’ll contact these providers with more information during the term.

### Providing internet connectivity

## How to query an allocation

> We’re currently prioritising delivering each school their current allocation to make sure they have devices to lend to pupils.

If the number of children unable to attend school and unable to access a device through other means is more than your allocation, you can email [COVID.TECHNOLOGY@education.gov.uk](mailto:covid.technology@education.gov.uk) to request more.

We’ll ask you for some information about the situation, including the information listed below. Before querying your allocation, you should make sure that children cannot access a device privately, or by being lent a device already owned by your school.

You’ll need to provide anonymised evidence that confirms:

* the year groups of the pupils for whom you are requesting additional devices
* how you’ve identified that these pupils are disadvantaged (such as whether pupils are pupil premium or in receipt of free school meals)
* how you know that the pupils do not have access to a private device (for example, through phone calls to families or a survey you’ve conducted about device ownership)
* that all the devices your school or college has already, have been distributed

### If you’re applying for a local authority or academy trust, you need to tell us:

* your unique reference number - for a local authority, this will be your 3-digit local authority number. For an academy trust, this will be your Companies House number. For a hospital school, this will be your LAESTAB number
* the name of the school your query is for and the number of additional devices required. If you’re requesting additional devices for more than one school, you’ll need to provide the number of additional devices required for each school

### If you’re applying for a school or college, you need to tell us:

* your unique reference number (URN), which is normally 6 digits. If you’re applying for a further education college, this will be your 8-digit UKPRN. If you don’t know your URN or UKPRN, you can find these on the [Get Information about Schools](https://get-information-schools.service.gov.uk/) site
* the name of your school
* the number of additional devices required

We’ll review your query and respond with a decision as soon as possible.

## Laptops, tablets and 4G wireless routers provided during the summer term 2020

Over 220,000 laptops and tablets were made available to distribute as part of the [first phase of the Get help with technology programme](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/laptops-tablets-and-4g-wireless-routers-provided-during-coronavirus-covid-19). The most disadvantaged and vulnerable young people and children were prioritised to make sure they can access social care and remote education.

The DfE considered all allocation queries raised by local authorities and academy trusts, and reviewed the submitted evidence against the initial allocation. DfE then compared those queries to similar requests received nationwide, and balanced these against the total number of devices available. More devices have been provided where there was an evidenced need to support eligible children.
