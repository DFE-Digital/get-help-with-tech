## How devices are allocated for pupils and students in academic year 21/22

Our approach to allocating devices provided from October 2021 is similar to last year.

Your allocation is based on free school meals or free meals data for your school, college or 
further education institution, and also takes account of the number of devices you may 
have received last year.

## How devices are allocated for care leavers and children supported by a social worker in 21/22

Devices are available in AY21/22 to support care leavers and children with supported by a social worker who:

* are aged between 16 and 25 years old
* do not have access to a laptop or tablet from their LA, or any other source.

## Device availability

After 1 March 2022, allocations do not guarantee that devices are available. You can only order devices while stocks last.

If you need to query your allocation, [contact us](/get-support).
