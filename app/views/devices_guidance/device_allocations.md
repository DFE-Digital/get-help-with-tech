## How devices are allocated

The number of devices we&rsquo;ve made available for you to order through the service 
reflects the number of laptops and tablets we estimate are needed by
your school, college or further education institution.

This calculation is based on:

* free school meals data
* free meals data for further education institutions
* an estimate of the number of devices a school or further education institution already has

## Requesting 4G routers

You can order 4G wireless routers for disadvantaged
pupils in years 3 to 11 and disadvantaged students in 16
to 19 further education.

## Querying allocations and ordering more devices

You can see your current allocation by signing in to the
[Get help with technology service](/sign-in).

If you find that your allocation is substantially lower than your school needs,
you can request more devices by [contacting us](/get-support). We cannot guarantee that
we&rsquo;ll be able to meet all requests, as we need to distribute devices among a
large number of schools and colleges in England.

Before requesting more laptops or tablets, make sure that pupils and students cannot access a device
privately or borrow one that the educational setting already owns.

You&rsquo;ll need to provide anonymised evidence to confirm:

* the ages of the pupils and students you&rsquo;re requesting additional 
devices for
* how you&rsquo;ve identified that they&rsquo;re disadvantaged 
(for example, whether they get free meals)
* how you know they cannot access a device privately, for example, by conducting a survey
about device ownership or speaking with families
* that all the educational setting&rsquo;s devices have already been distributed

### If you&rsquo;re applying for a local authority or academy trust, you need to tell us:

* the LAESTAB number for a hospital school
* the name of the school the query is for and the number of additional
devices required. If you&rsquo;re requesting additional devices for more than one
school, you&rsquo;ll need to provide the number of additional devices required for
each school

### If you&rsquo;re applying for a school, college or further education institution, you need to tell us:

* your unique reference number (URN), which is normally 6 digits. If you&rsquo;re
applying for a further education college, this will be your 8-digit UKPRN. If
you don&rsquo;t know your URN or UKPRN, you can find these on the 
[Get Information about Schools](https://get-information-schools.service.gov.uk/) site
* the name of your school, college or further education institution
* the number of additional devices required

We&rsquo;ll review your query and respond with a decision as soon as possible.

## How to request devices for children and young people attending hospital school

Devices can be requested at any time for disadvantaged pupils and students in any year group:

* because they are [clinically extremely vulnerable](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/guidance-on-shielding-and-protecting-extremely-vulnerable-persons-from-covid-19/guidance-on-shielding-and-protecting-extremely-vulnerable-persons-from-covid-19)
* in 16 to 19 education, attending a hospital school

[Contact us](/get-support) to make a request.

Do not submit any personally identifiable information about pupils that we do
not need to process your support query. If we receive a request that contains
such information, we&rsquo;ll ask you to resend it.
