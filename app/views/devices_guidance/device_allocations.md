## How devices were allocated for pupils and students in academic year 21/22

Our approach to allocating devices provided from October 2021 was similar to the previous year.

Allocations were based on free school meals or free meals data for your school, college or
further education institution, and also took account of the number of devices you may
have received in the previous year.

## How devices were allocated for care leavers and children supported by a social worker in 21/22

Devices were available in AY21/22 to support care leavers and children with supported by a social worker who:

* were aged between 16 and 25 years old
* did not have access to a laptop or tablet from their LA, or any other source.
