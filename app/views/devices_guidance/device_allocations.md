## How devices are allocated

### Laptops and tablets for schools, academy trusts and local authorities after September 2020

The number of devices available to order through the [Get help with technology service](/start) reflects the number of laptops and tablets we estimate are needed by each school. This calculation is based on:

* free school meals data
* an estimate of the number of devices a school already has

We’ve allocated laptops and tablets in line with the data we’re seeing that suggests that most schools have smaller groups of children self-isolating at any one time, rather than closing fully. Schools are able to redistribute devices when children return from self-isolation. This more targeted approach will mean that as many schools and disadvantaged children as possible can benefit from receiving a device if their face-to-face education is disrupted.

## How to query an allocation

You’ll be able to order your current allocation during term time when you report a closure or that more than 15 children are self-isolating through the [educational setting status form](https://form.education.gov.uk/service/educational-setting-status).

If your school is supporting a disadvantaged child in any year group who has been advised not to attend school because they (or someone they live with) is clinically extremely vulnerable, you should request devices to lend to these children by emailing [COVID.TECHNOLOGY@education.gov.uk](mailto:covid.technology@education.gov.uk).

If the number of children unable to attend school and unable to access a device through other means is more than your allocation at that time (including if your school is fully closed), you can email [COVID.TECHNOLOGY@education.gov.uk](mailto:covid.technology@education.gov.uk) to request more. Requests will be reviewed on a case-by-case basis and allocations may be increased in exceptional circumstances.

We’ll ask you for some information about the situation, including the information listed below. Before querying your allocation, you should make sure that children cannot access a device privately, or by being lent a device already owned by your school.

### If you’re applying for a local authority or academy trust, you need to tell us:

* your unique reference number - for a local authority, this will be your three-digit local authority number. For an academy trust, this will be your Companies House number. For a hospital school, this will be your LAESTAB number.
* the name of the school your query is for and the number of additional devices required. If you’re requesting additional devices for more than one school, you’ll need to provide the number of additional devices required for each school.

### If you’re applying for a school or college, you need to tell us:

* your unique reference number (URN), this is normally 6 digits. If you’re applying for a further education college, this will be your 8-digit UKPRN. If you don’t know your URN or UKPRN, you can find these on the [Get Information about Schools](https://get-information-schools.service.gov.uk/) site.
* the name of your school.
* the number of additional devices required.

We’ll review your query and respond with a decision as soon as possible.

## Laptops, tablets and 4G wireless routers provided during the summer term 2020

Over 220,000 laptops and tablets were made available to distribute as part of the [first phase of the Get help with technology programme](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/laptops-tablets-and-4g-wireless-routers-provided-during-coronavirus-covid-19). The most disadvantaged and vulnerable young people and children were prioritised to make sure they can access social care and remote education.

The DfE considered all allocation queries raised by local authorities and academy trusts, and reviewed the submitted evidence against the initial allocation. The department then compared those queries to similar requests it received nationwide, and balanced it against the total number of devices available. More devices have been provided where there was an evidenced need to support eligible children.
