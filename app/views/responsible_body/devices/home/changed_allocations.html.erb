    <p class="govuk-body">We’ve changed how we allocate laptops and tablets. This is to get them to those in greatest need as effectively as we can.</p>

    <p class="govuk-body">We know most schools have small groups of children self-isolating at any one time. We believe the revised allocations should provide enough devices to support these groups.</p>

    <p class="govuk-body">Once children who had been self-isolating return to school, schools may choose to reallocate devices so as many pupils as possible can benefit from them.</p>

    <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">If a school closes fully</h2>

    <p class="govuk-body">If a school closes fully, we’ll email you to explain what your options are, including how to request more devices.</p>

    <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">If you think schools need more devices</h2>

    <p class="govuk-body">If schools face extremely challenging circumstances, you can request more devices by emailing <%= ghwt_contact_mailto(subject: 'More devices request') %>.</p>
