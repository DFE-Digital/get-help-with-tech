      Who needs to reset devices
    </h3>

    <p class="govuk-body">
      You do not need to reset devices provided by the Get help with technology programme
      from October 2021 onwards. This is because devices provided from this date onwards do
      not include content filtering or device management software.
    </p>

    <p class="govuk-body">
      If you received &lsquo;DfE-restricted&rsquo; Windows devices before this date, you&rsquo;ll need to reset
      them. You do not need to reset &lsquo;standard&rsquo; Windows devices, Chromebooks or iPads.
    </p>

    <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">
      Why DfE-restricted Windows devices need to be reset
    </h3>

    <p class="govuk-body">
      Restricted Windows devices provided though the Get help with technology programme
      came with security software. It was due to expire on <span class="app-no-wrap">30 September 2021</span>, but to ensure
      devices remained safe for children and young people to use, we extended licences until
      <span class="app-no-wrap">30 September 2022</span>. You&rsquo;re still required to reset devices and apply your own safeguarding
      settings as soon as possible.
    </p>

    <p class="govuk-body">
      When licences expire, users will be able to freely access any online content. Devices will
      not be maintained with future updates including virus scans and software upgrades. It&rsquo;s
      your responsibility to

      What you need to do
    </h3>

    <p class="govuk-body">
      Restricted Windows laptops and tablets need to be restored to factory settings. This
      removes existing device management and content filtering software so you can apply your
      own.

    <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">Help with retrieving DfE-restricted Windows devices</h3>

    <p class="govuk-body">
      We have 2 remote services to help organisations retrieve devices from children and young
      people so they can be reset.
    </p>

    <h4 class="govuk-heading-m">Remote messaging</h4>

    <p class="govuk-body">
      We can display a message on the device&rsquo;s login screen, lock screen, desktop background
      and as a popup message. The message will say that the device needs a critical update,
      and that the user should contact the organisation that gave it to them to arrange this.
    </p>

    <h4 class="govuk-heading-m">Restricting internet access</h4>

    <p class="govuk-body">
      We can also disable the device&rsquo;s internet access. A message will be displayed on the lock
      screen and desktop background stating that it needs a critical update, and that the user
      should contact the organisation that gave it to them to arrange this.
    </p>

    <p class="govuk-body">
