    <p class="govuk-body">We reduced the number of laptops and tablets allocated to schools.</p>

    <p class="govuk-body">We know most schools have small groups of children self-isolating at any one time. We believe the revised allocations should provide enough devices to support these groups.</p>

    <p class="govuk-body">Once children who had been self-isolating return to school, schools may choose to reallocate devices so as many pupils as possible can benefit from them.</p>

    <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">If your school closes fully</h2>

    <p class="govuk-body">If your school closes fully, and there are still devices in stock, you’ll be able to order more. We’ll email you to explain what your options are if this happens.</p>

    <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">If you think you need more devices</h2>

    <p class="govuk-body">If you’re facing extremely challenging circumstances, you can request more devices by emailing <%= ghwt_contact_mailto(subject: 'More devices request') %>.</p>

    <p class="govuk-body">Please be aware that we’ll ask you to provide more information, and there’s no guarantee you’ll get all the devices you request.</p>
