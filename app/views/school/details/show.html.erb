      About allocations
    </h2>

    <p class="govuk-body">
      We’ve changed the way we allocate devices. From 23 October, allocations are based on:
    </p>

    <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
      <li>the number of children in years 3 to 11</li>
      <li>free school meals data</li>
      <li>an estimate of the number of devices a school already has</li>
      <li>the number of devices we think you may need if you have a bubble self-isolating</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="govuk-body">
      If the number of pupils unable to attend school and in need of devices is greater than your allocation at that time, you can email <%= ghwt_contact_mailto %> to request more. We’ll only be able to approve such requests in exceptional circumstances.
