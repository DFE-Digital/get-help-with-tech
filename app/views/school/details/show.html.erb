      About allocations
    </h2>
    <p class="govuk-body">Allocations are based on:</p>
    <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
      <li>the number of children in years 3 to 11</li>
      <li>free school meals data</li>
      <li>an estimate of the number of devices a school already has</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="govuk-body">Your allocation could change. If there are widespread school closures, we might reduce it.</p>
    <p class="govuk-body">If you need to query your allocation, email <%= ghwt_contact_mailto %></p>

      About Google Chromebooks
    </h2>

    <p class="govuk-body">It’s possible to order a range of different devices (laptops, tablets, Chromebooks). If you are going to order Google Chromebooks, we’ll need 2 pieces of information to configure them:</p>
    <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet govuk-!-margin-bottom-6">
      <li>the domain your school uses for its Google services</li>
      <li>the school’s recovery email address</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="govuk-body">We need this information so we can secure the devices.</p>

    <p class="govuk-body">
      If you need help finding these details, speak to the people you usually contact for IT support.
