Government-funded support is no longer available for schools and colleges to get set 
up on a digital education platform. The closing date for all applications was 30 November 2021.

If your school would still like to have access to a digital education platform, you&rsquo;ll still 
be able to sign up and apply directly for either a 
[Google Workspace Fundamentals](https://gsuite.google.com/signup/edu/welcome#0) 
or 
[Office 365 platform](https://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/education/products/office),
free of charge.

If your school needs technical support for a new platform set up, you&rsquo;ll need to fund
this alongside other standard ICT support spending.

You should apply if your school:

* does not have access to a digital education platform
* has access to Microsoft 365 Education or Google Workspace for Education 
  Fundamentals, but is not yet set up to assign work and communicate with 
  pupils and students.

## What is a digital education platform?

It&rsquo;s a place where teachers, pupils and students can continue education through 
online virtual classrooms if a school or college closes.

The platforms are purpose-built for remote learning in a way that a school or college
website is not.

Teachers can:

* communicate with pupils and students and deliver lessons via video calls
* record virtual lessons
* set tasks
* let pupils and students work together through supervised group calls
* give personalised feedback via video or within shared documents
* continue with formal assessment for learning
* set up separate classrooms for smaller groups of students
* develop structured file and folder storage for different users
* use tools to support staff planning.

has information on why you should make the 
move to a digital education platform, if you have not already.

## How schools benefited from the programme

Almost 7,000 schools applied to the platforms programme from April 2020 until the
