## About the scheme

Many vulnerable and disadvantaged children and young people in England do not have access to a laptop, tablet or internet connection. The Department for Education (DfE) is offering support to help children, young people and families access remote education and social care during coronavirus (COVID-19).

The DfE is working with a delivery partner to supply local authorities, academy trusts and schools with [laptops, tablets and connectivity packages](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/get-help-with-technology-for-remote-education-during-coronavirus-covid-19). 

We also offer guidance and a support team to help you order, distribute and manage these devices.

## How to get support

If you need help to [order laptops and tablets](/start), please [see our guidance section below](#allocation-and-ordering-devices). 

If you need help with a laptop, tablet or 4G wireless router youâ€™ve already received from us, please see our guidance below on [setting devices up](#setting-devices-up), or [managing devices and safeguarding](#managing-devices-and-safeguarding).

If you cannot find the information you need here, please email [COVID.TECHNOLOGY@education.gov.uk](mailto:COVID.TECHNOLOGY@education.gov.uk). We aim to respond within 3 working days.
