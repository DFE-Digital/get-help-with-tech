## About the scheme

Internet access supports remote education, as well as virtual contact between children, their social workers and other services.

We know that many children do not have reliable internet access, and we’re acting to change this by:

- [giving children free access to wifi hotspots](https://get-help-with-tech.education.gov.uk/about-bt-wifi)
- [increasing data allowances on mobile devices](https://get-help-with-tech.education.gov.uk/about-increasing-mobile-data)

We’ve also provided more than 50,000 [4G wireless routers](https://get-help-with-tech.education.gov.uk/devices/preparing-4g-wireless-routers) to local authorities and academy trusts this year.

## Who can get help

### [Free access to BT wifi hotspots](https://get-help-with-tech.education.gov.uk/about-bt-wifi)

The Department for Education is running a pilot scheme that gives children and young people free access to BT wifi hotspots. If they live in range of a BT hotspot, their school will give them log-in details to access the network.

Available for families with children from early years up to 16, and care leavers up to 25 if they:

- do not have access to a [fixed broadband connection](https://www.ofcom.org.uk/phones-telecoms-and-internet/advice-for-consumers/advice/broadband-speeds/broadband-basics)
- cannot afford the additional data needed to access educational resources or social care services
- have access to a BT hotspot (coverage varies depending on where they live)

### [Increasing data allowances on children’s mobile devices](https://get-help-with-tech.education.gov.uk/about-increasing-mobile-data)

We’re running a pilot scheme to temporarily increase data allowances on certain mobile devices. This is so disadvantaged children and young people can continue their remote education and maintain contact with social care services without incurring extra data charges.

This support is available for children from early years up to 16, and care leavers up to 25 if they:

- do not have access to a [fixed broadband connection](https://www.ofcom.org.uk/phones-telecoms-and-internet/advice-for-consumers/advice/broadband-speeds/broadband-basics)
- cannot afford the additional data needed to access social care services or educational resources while learning at home [cannot access a BT hotspot](https://get-help-with-tech.education.gov.uk/about-bt-wifi)
- are an existing customer of a [participating mobile network operator](https://get-help-with-tech.education.gov.uk/about-increasing-mobile-data#whos-on-board) (for some operators, they’ll need to be on a pay monthly contract)
