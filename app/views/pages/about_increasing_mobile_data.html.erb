      This scheme temporarily increases data allowances for mobile phone users on certain networks. This is so that disadvantaged children and young people can access remote education if their face-to-face education is disrupted, and they do not have access to broadband at home.
    </p>

    <h2 class="govuk-heading-l">Who can get help</h2>

    <p class="govuk-body">Schools, trusts and local authorities (ordering for maintained schools) in England can request mobile data increases for disadvantaged children and young people in years 3 to 11 who are not able to attend school due to national lockdown restrictions. They must meet all 3 of these criteria:</p>

    <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
      <li>do not have fixed broadband at home</li>
      <li>cannot afford additional data for their devices </li>
      <li>are experiencing disruption to their face-to-face education</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p class="govuk-body">Schools, trusts and local authorities can also make requests for children and young people who meet the criteria above, and are:</p>

    </ul>
  
  <h2 class="govuk-heading-l">Which mobile networks can increase data</h2>

    <p class="govuk-body">Children with access to a mobile phone on one of the following networks might be able to benefit:</p>

    <h2 class="govuk-heading-l">How to request a mobile data increase</h2>

    <p class="govuk-body">For each request, we need to know:</p>

      <li>the name of the mobile phone account holder</li>
      <li>the number of the mobile device</li>
      <li>the mobile network of that device (for example Three)</li>
