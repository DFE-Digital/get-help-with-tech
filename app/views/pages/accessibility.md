Get help with technology is a service from the Department for Education.

We designed it using [GOV.UK accessible design principles](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/accessibility/).

Throughout most of the service, users should be able to:

* change colours, contrast levels and fonts
* zoom in up to 300% without the text spilling off the screen
* navigate using just a keyboard
* navigate using speech recognition software
* listen to the content using a screen reader (including recent versions of JAWS, NVDA and VoiceOver)
