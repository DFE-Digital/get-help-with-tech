Get help with technology is a service from the Department for Education. We designed it using [GOV.UK accessible design principles](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/accessibility/).

We want as many people as possible to be able to use this website. For example, that means you should be able to:

* change colours, contrast levels and fonts
* zoom in up to 300% without the text spilling off the screen
* navigate using just a keyboard
* navigate using speech recognition software
* listen to the content using a screen reader (including recent versions of JAWS, NVDA and VoiceOver)

## What to do if you cannot access parts of this service

If you need information in a different format, email [COVID.TECHNOLOGY@education.gov.uk](mailto:COVID.TECHNOLOGY@education.gov.uk) and
we&rsquo;ll respond to you within 3 working days. It will help us if you can tell us what assistive technology you use.

[AbilityNet](https://mcmw.abilitynet.org.uk/) has advice on making your device easier to use if you have a disability. They
have a free helpline on 0800 048 7642. You can also email: [enquiries@abilitynet.org.uk](mailto:enquiries@abilitynet.org.uk)
