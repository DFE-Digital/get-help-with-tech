    <p class="govuk-body">The Get help with technology programme offers 2 ways to help children and young people connect to the internet if face-to-face education is disrupted.</p>

    <p class="govuk-body">We can provide:</p>

    <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
      <li>extra data for mobile devices</li>
      <li>4G wireless routers</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="govuk-body">Schools can request one type of support per child.</p>

    <p class="govuk-body">To help you decide which option may be best for a particular child, use the information here to compare both.</p>

    </h2>

    <p class="govuk-body">You can request an increase in mobile data for a child or parent who has an existing mobile contract with a participating network if they are unable to access broadband internet at home.</p>

    <p class="govuk-body">The recipient will get an increase in mobile data on a monthly basis until July 2021. Note that not all participating networks can support pay-as-you-go customers.</p>

    <p class="govuk-body">Choose this option if:</p>
    <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
      <li>the account holder is with a <%= govuk_link_to 'participating network', guide_to_collecting_mobile_information_telling_about_offer_path %></li>
      <li>the child or young person can use the mobile device’s internet connection on a device suitable for learning (this is known as tethering)</li>
      <li>the owner of the mobile device will be at home when the child or young person is learning remotely</li>
      <li>the mobile phone has a strong signal at home</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="govuk-body">There’s no content filtering with mobile data increases, so if the child will be unsupervised while using the internet, it may be better to choose a 4G wireless router.</p>

    <p class="govuk-body">4G wireless routers are compact digital devices, sometimes referred to as ‘dongles’ or ‘mobile wifi’, that provide an internet connection wherever there is access to mobile networks.</p>

    <p class="govuk-body">Choose this option if:</p>
    <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
      <li>the extra data for mobile devices option is not suitable</li>
      <li>there’s more than one child in the household who needs to learn remotely</li>
      <li>a mobile phone or tablet (tethered or not) is not regularly available for the child’s use</li>
      <li>frequent phone calls to the mobile phone being used tend to interrupt school work</li>
      <li>the child is likely to access the internet without supervision</li>
