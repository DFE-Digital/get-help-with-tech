      Who can get help
    </h2>

    <p class="govuk-body">
      We recommend you check if disadvantaged children can <%= govuk_link_to 'get a free mobile data increase from their network provider', 'https://get-help-with-tech.education.gov.uk/about-increasing-mobile-data', target: '_blank', rel: 'noopener noreferrer' %> before requesting a router.
    </p>

    <p class="govuk-body">
      You can request 4G wireless routers for disadvantaged children and young people if:
    </p>

    <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
      <li>their face-to-face education has been disrupted</li>
      <li>they do not have internet access at home</li>
      <li>they cannot get a mobile data increase</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="govuk-body">
      Routers are available to those:
    </p>

    <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
      <li>in years 3 to 13</li>
      <li>in further education who get free meals</li>
      <li>in any year group who have been <%= govuk_link_to 'advised to shield', 'https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/guidance-on-shielding-and-protecting-extremely-vulnerable-persons-from-covid-19/guidance-on-shielding-and-protecting-extremely-vulnerable-persons-from-covid-19', target: '_blank', rel: 'noopener noreferrer' %> because they (or someone they live with) are clinically extremely vulnerable</li>

      How to get 4G wireless routers
    </h2>

    <p class="govuk-body">
      The process for ordering 4G wireless routers is different to that for ordering laptops and tablets. Routers may be dispatched separately to any laptops and tablets you order, and may arrive at a later date.
    </p>

    <h3 class="govuk-heading-l">
      For local authorities and academy trusts
    </h3>

     <p class="govuk-inset-text">
      Local authorities and academy trusts that received 4G wireless routers from DfE during the 2020 summer term are expected to reallocate any unused routers to children in need before ordering new ones. Your key contact can log in to the <%= govuk_link_to 'Support Portal', 'https://computacenterprod.service-now.com/dfe' %> to check router use.
    </p>

    <p class="govuk-body">
      To request 4G wireless routers, send the following information to <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:COVID.TECHNOLOGY@education.gov.uk">COVID.TECHNOLOGY@education.gov.uk</a>:
    </p>

    <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
      <li>your unique reference number – for a local authority, this will be your three-digit local authority number. For an academy trust, this will be your Companies House number</li>
      <li>the name of the school you’re making a request for and the number of routers needed. If you’re requesting additional routers for more than one school, you’ll need to provide the number of children needing an internet connection for each school</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="govuk-body">
      We'll also need evidence of:
    </p>

    <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
      <li>how you’ve identified disadvantage, such as the number of children in receipt of free school meals or pupil premium</li>
      <li>your understanding of children, young people and families’ access to internet connectivity - this information could be from survey data, calls home, your awareness of specific family circumstances, demographic data, or questions asked to parents</li>
      <li>disadvantaged pupils joining the school since the most recent School Workforce Census</li>

      How requests are managed
    </h2>

    <p class="govuk-body">
      All requests are assessed against the eligibility criteria by our support team who will email you if any additional information is required, and with details of whether your request has been successful.
    </p>
    
    <p class="govuk-body">
      Availability may change. We have a limited number of routers available and may not be able to give you the number you’ve requested.
