      Getting 4G wireless routers
    </h2>

    <p class="govuk-body">
      The process for ordering 4G wireless routers is different to that for ordering laptops. Routers may be sent separately to any laptops you order, and may arrive at a later date.
    </p>

    <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">
      For local authorities and academy trusts
    </h3>

    <p class="govuk-inset-text">
      Local authorities and academy trusts that received 4G wireless routers from DfE during the 2020 summer term should reallocate any unused routers to children in need before ordering new ones. <%= govuk_link_to 'Sign in to the Support Portal', 'https://computacenterprod.service-now.com/dfe' %>to check router use.

      <li>Your unique reference number – for a local authority, this will be your 3-digit local authority number. For an academy trust, this will be your Companies House number.</li>
      <li>The name of the school you’re making a request for and the number of routers needed. If you’re requesting additional routers for more than one school, you’ll need to provide the number of children needing an internet connection for each school.</li>

      For schools, colleges and other FE institutions
    </h3>

    <p class="govuk-body">
      Once schools, colleges and FE institutions have placed an order for devices through the Get help with technology service, they can request 4G wireless routers too.
    </p>

    <p class="govuk-body">
      Unlike allocations for laptops and tablets (which are based on free meals data), we distribute wireless routers based on actual need. This is because the need for connectivity is lower than the need for devices.
    </p>

    <p class="govuk-body">
      To make a request for wireless routers for your students, you need to provide information about how you’ve identified the number of learners requiring help with connectivity.

      Availability may change. We have a limited number of 4G wireless routers available and may not be able to give you the number you’ve requested.
