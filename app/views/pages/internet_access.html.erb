Schools, trusts and local authorities can help disadvantaged children get online using free mobile data increases or 4G wireless routers provided by the Department for Education. You can request this support if each of the following applies:
    </p>

    <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
      <li>your school is experiencing disruption to face-to-face education</li>
     <li>the disadvantaged children youâ€™re responsible for do not have access to the internet at home</li>
      <li>your school has been invited to order laptops and tablets</li>

      Increasing data allowances on mobile phones
    </h2>

    <p class="govuk-body">
This scheme temporarily increases data allowances for mobile phone users on <%= govuk_link_to 'certain networks', about_increasing_mobile_data_path %>. This will allow other devices to connect to the internet via a mobile phone so children and young people can access remote education if their face-to-face education is disrupted.    </p>

    <p class="govuk-body">
This support is now available to all schools with children in years 3 to 11.

      4G wireless routers
    </h2>

    <p class="govuk-body">
Schools, trusts and local authorities in England can request more 4G wireless routers for disadvantaged children in years 3 to 11 who are experiencing disruption to face-to-face education and do not have access to the internet at home.    </p>

    <p class="govuk-body">The process for ordering 4G wireless routers is different to that for ordering laptops and tablets. Routers may be dispatched separately to any laptops and tablets you order, and may arrive at a later date.

      Offering free access to BT wifi hotspots
    </h2>

    <p class="govuk-body">
      This pilot has now closed.
    </p>

    <p class="govuk-body">
      BT created 10,000 hotspot log-ins that could be activated through name/password combinations. If children and young people lived in range of a BT hotspot, their school offered them log-in details for free.
    </p>

    <p class="govuk-body">
      When we tested this scheme, we found the majority of users could not get a reliable BT wifi connection. As a result, we decided to close the pilot.
    </p>

    <p class="govuk-body">
      All BT vouchers distributed expired at the end of December 2020.
