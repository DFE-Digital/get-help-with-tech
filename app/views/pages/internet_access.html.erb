      Increasing mobile phone data allowances
    </h2>

    <p class="govuk-body">
This scheme temporarily increases data allowances for mobile phone users on certain networks. This will allow other devices to connect to the internet via a mobile phone so children and young people can access remote education if their face-to-face education is disrupted.    </p>

    <p class="govuk-body">
Currently, this support is available to a small number of selected schools. We’ll let other schools know as we extend the scheme.    </p>

Schools, trusts and local authorities in England can request 4G wireless routers for disadvantaged or vulnerable children who are experiencing disruption to face-to-face education if they do not have access to the internet at home.    </p>

      Offering free access to BT wifi hotspots
    </h2>

    <p class="govuk-body">
      This pilot has now closed.
    </p>

    <p class="govuk-body">
      BT created 10,000 hotspot log-ins that could be activated through name/password combinations. If children and young people lived in range of a BT hotspot, their school offered them log-in details for free.
    </p>

    <p class="govuk-body">
      When we tested this scheme, we found the majority of users couldn’t get a reliable BT wifi connection. As such, we decided to close the pilot.
    </p>

    <p class="govuk-body">
      Any vouchers already in use will continue to work until the end of December 2020.
