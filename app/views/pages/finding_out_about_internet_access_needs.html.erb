    <p class="govuk-body">
      Children and young people may not be able to access digital remote education at home
      because they do not have access to the internet, or their internet access is not sufficient
      (for example, it may have data usage limits).
    </p>

    <p class="govuk-body">
      You may already have some understanding of access requirements for your pupils or
      students, but the information below can help you to find out exactly what&rsquo;s needed.
    </p>

    <h2 class="govuk-heading-l">Internet access</h2>

    <p class="govuk-body">
      &lsquo;Internet access&rsquo; means different things to different people. For example, they may not
      recognise that they pay for broadband as part of a TV/phone bundle. Clarify with parents
      and carers, or young people if they live independently, what they&rsquo;re able to do online, for
      example are they able to do their homework without waiting for long periods for a website
      to load?
    </p>

    <p class="govuk-body">
      Specifying types of internet access at home may be difficult. Ask respondents about the
      types of issues and worries they may face.
    </p>

    <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
      <li>How do you normally access the internet? (for example, through fixed line broadband or a mobile connection).</li>
      <li>Does a member of your household pay for your access to the internet?</li>
      <li>Are you and your family ever unable to access the internet because you cannot make extra payments for data or meet monthly payments?</li>
      <li>Have you or your family recently cancelled an agreement, with no replacement, which gave you internet access?</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="govuk-heading-l">Surveys</h2>

    <p class="govuk-body">
      Use surveys to check whether families know about existing options that may be available
      if they&rsquo;re on a low income. Explore other benefits, such as affordable tariffs with eligibility
      criteria
      (<%= govuk_link_to 'examples of these are listed by Ofcom', 'https://www.ofcom.org.uk/about-ofcom/latest/media/media-releases/2021/help-customers-struggling-to-pay-bills' %>).
      Contact telecoms/mobile providers to ask
      what support they offer and find out about support from social housing providers.
    </p>

    <p class="govuk-body">
      You may also be able to target surveys about internet access by focusing on:
    </p>

    <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
      <li>
        families of children and young people who&rsquo;ve been lent devices to support remote
        education
      </li>
      <li>
        families of children and young people who you&rsquo;ve previously supported with
        internet access options available through the Get help with technology service or
        other sources
      </li>
      <li>
        reviewing information from use of your learning platform, if available, to identify
        children and young people who&rsquo;ve struggled to log on and stay connected with
        online learning
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="govuk-heading-l">Mobile and broadband internet access</h2>

    <p class="govuk-body">
      If a family is struggling to afford the cost of internet access, there are affordable tariffs
      available from some telecom providers. These tariffs reduce the cost of staying online and
      may help families that might not be able to meet standard broadband contract terms.
