<h2 class="govuk-heading-m">1. Check who is eligible for extra mobile data</h2>

<p class="govuk-body">You can request extra mobile data for disadvantaged children who:</p>

<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
  <li>have no broadband connection at home</li>
  <li>cannot afford additional data</li>
</ul>

<p class="govuk-body">One of the following must also apply. They are children:</p>
<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
  <li>in years 3 to 11 and whose face-to-face education is disrupted</li>
  <li>who are <%= govuk_link_to 'clinically extremely vulnerable', 'https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/guidance-on-shielding-and-protecting-extremely-vulnerable-persons-from-covid-19/guidance-on-shielding-and-protecting-extremely-vulnerable-persons-from-covid-19', target: '_blank', rel: 'noopener noreferrer' %> and need to shield on current official advice (this could be from a doctor or hospital consultant)</li>
  <li>who live in a household that’s been advised to shield because a family member is clinically extremely vulnerable</li>
  <li>who cannot attend school – even though theirs is open – because restrictions prevent it</li>

<p class="govuk-body">Once you submit mobile numbers and network details through our service, we’ll request extra data. How much data someone gets will depend on their network.</p>
