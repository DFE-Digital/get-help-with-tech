// Ideally this should not be needed -
// we should be setting the class govuk-!-display-inline-block
// on the .govuk-form-group elements. But they get rendered by
// the govuk_collection_select helper, which seems to be dropping
// any html_options: {class: '...'} param somewhere in the chain.
// This is a temporary workaround
.govuk-form-group.display-child-forms-inline {
  .govuk-form-group {
    display: inline-block;

// Elements with this class will be shown by JS on document.ready
.js-only {
  display: none;
